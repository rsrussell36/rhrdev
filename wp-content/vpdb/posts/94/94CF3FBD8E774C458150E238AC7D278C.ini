She is known as an energetic, creative, and solutions-focused leader as well as a highly effective executive coach. Orla’s signature approach, both for herself and her practice, is grounded in her motivation to empower leaders and senior teams to achieve their full potential.

Orla’s influence has shaped and reenergized the Senior Team Effectiveness practice, delivering tangible, enhanced performance in senior teams across industries, including  beverage, fast-moving consumer goods, pharmaceutical, and professional services. Working with Orla and the practice, senior teams are able to align around a compelling organizational agenda and adopt the leadership behavior necessary to execute it. The market-leading outcomes fostered by the Senior Team Effectiveness practice are a result of Orla spearheading an enhanced new model and the option to deliver the training with a cutting-edge virtual delivery method. Orla herself is a citizen of the world, and the ability to deliver Senior Team Effectiveness coaching virtually has only amplified the practice’s reach across borders. Across Europe, Asia, Australia, the United States, and Canada, Orla has helped senior teams discover new avenues and pathways to success, developing themselves and unlocking their true potential.

In her executive coaching work, Orla is a leading corporate psychologist, assessing executives and understanding trends in data in order to facilitate meaningful change. She creates strong, long-term partnerships, delivering a positive impact and empowering her clients to learn and grow. A particular element of this is Orla’s work with women in leadership, helping to dismantle the structural barriers that all too often stand in the way of women’s success.

Prior to joining RHR International, Orla worked as a principal psychologist and practice-area manager for team development with the UK-based company Sigma. Notably, she has conducted in-depth research and designed psychometric instruments to identify innovation potential in individuals. She is a verified assessor with the British Psychological Society and is an accredited trainer and faculty member of the Association for Psychological Type.

When she isn’t working, Orla can be found spending time with her husband and two daughters. She is a dedicated runner and also an involved member of her book group, reflecting her curiosity and desire to learn along with her ability to constantly push for higher levels of performance."
