post_content = "Amy Meek has served as a project coordinator at RHR International since 2014. She provides detailed planning and execution support for both client-facing engagements and internal firm initiatives, assisting the teams she supports to continuously and reliably deliver outstanding leadership solutions to RHR’s network.

In her role, Amy provides key support in organizing, expanding, and engaging RHR’s professional network. She applies her expertise to developing tools and training, implementing strategic priorities, and collaborating with consultants and project coordinators across regions and practices areas as well as outside partners and resources to implement new programs and initiatives.

Amy also impacts the client-facing side of RHR’s operations. She has a track record of successfully managing large, complex engagements with rigor and precision, including managing the logistics of client and consultant interactions and overseeing the resulting timeline and documentation implications. She is particularly adept at coordinating projects with challenging timelines and successfully managed an international engagement that required the delivery of more than 300 executive-level assessments in a period of four months.

Amy is well-known as a reliable, responsive, and detail-oriented person. She brings her values of proactive communication, engaging teamwork, and impeccable organization and planning to everything she does. Amy enjoys collaborating with others around the firm and acting as a mentor to newer staff, helping to onboard recently hired project coordinators and ensuring that they feel supported and enabled to achieve their full potential at RHR. Amy developed her project-management expertise through a varied career working in photography, financial services, training facilitation, and operations management. Having earned an undergraduate degree in psychology and an MBA in her graduate studies, Amy also brings a business-oriented perspective to her work.

Amy enjoys collaborating with colleagues to raise awareness of and promote change in response to the climate crisis and is a founding member of RHR’s Forces of Nature team. In her spare time, Amy enjoys traveling with family and friends to visit new places around the world (including planning all of the details and logistics of each trip, of course), reading or listening to a good book while relaxing in or near a body of water, and exploring the Arizona desert with her husband and their feisty terrier."
