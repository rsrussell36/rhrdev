post_content = "This year at RHR International, we covered many topics on leadership. Here are the top blog posts as of 2018 according to readers.

1. <a href=\"https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/employee-turnover-why-good-people-leave\">Employee Turnover: Why Good People Leave</a>

As a leader, it is particularly painful when top talent chooses to leave the company. Learn why good employees leave and find out how companies can retain key staff.

2. <a href=\"https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/gender-bias-balancing-tightrope\">Gender Bias: Balancing on the Tightrope</a>

The tightrope refers to the need for women to master a balancing act between being seen as too masculine to be likable and too feminine to be competent—and ultimately respected—and is the bias most commonly experienced by female executives.

3. <a href=\"https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/managing-power-top\">Managing Power at the Top</a>

Managing influence and power at the top is not a given, yet the ability to do this well will be a make-or-break factor for the leader and the organization. To help CEOs sort out whether they are managing power effectively, it is helpful to understand the ways power is mismanaged.

4. <a href=\"https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/intentionality-and-decision-making-senior-team\">Intentionality and Decision Making in the Senior Team</a>

Effective leadership often comes down to two critical and complex tasks: making good decisions and engaging others to execute those decisions. Making good decisions at the upper level requires a deep understanding of how optimal decision-making occurs as well as the pitfalls.

5. <a href=\"https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/foolish-things-leaders-do\">Foolish Things Leaders Do</a>

We know you’re no fool. You’re insightful and decisive. You blow away your quarterly goals while keeping your company well-positioned for the next few decades. So fill up that Best Boss Ever mug and read on, thinking about people you know who may need this advice."
