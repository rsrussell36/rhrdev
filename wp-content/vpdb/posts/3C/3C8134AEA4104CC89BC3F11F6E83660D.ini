post_content = "Steven Gilbert is a Senior Partner and leads RHR’s private equity business vertical. Leveraging his sharp analytical skills, psychology background, and multinational worldview, he coaches leaders across a variety of industries. Steven works closely with CEOs and management teams of privately equity-owned portfolio companies as they embark on rapid scaling and professionalization. He understands the challenges inherent in this journey and works closely with leaders to help them make the transition. He has 16+ years of experience delivering and leading executive assessment, coaching, team development and organizational change initiatives.

Steven’s professional purpose is to positively impact the way people experience the world of work. Through strong partnership, understanding, and encouragement — and with plenty of adjusting and readjusting along the way — Steven strives to understand the potential and capability within each unique individual. He’s able to quickly generate insights and understand the intricate, nuanced interplay between people and business. He does so with energy and candor, creating a space and opportunity for leaders to be their best selves.

Diversity is also a crucial component to Steven’s viewpoint on leadership. He possesses a deep appreciation of what it means to bring varying perspectives, cultures, and experience levels to the table, viewing leadership through a global lens thanks to his own multinational background. Having grown up in the UK and lived in Spain, Singapore, Canada, and the United States, he is well-equipped with a perspective that enables him to work with companies and leaders from all over the world.

Before he joined RHR in 2005, Steven began his career in the UK as a psychiatric nurse. He pivoted soon thereafter to business and psychology, determined to strengthen the management and leadership systems that ultimately impact the lives of many. His work in counseling psychology allowed him to hone his skills for engaging and partnering with others — a crucial component of understanding his clients on a molecular level and helping them thrive.

When Steven’s not working, you can find him spending time with his wife and daughter, traversing trails with his Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, cooking with fresh herbs from his garden, playing guitar, traveling, or golfing. He earned a bachelor’s degree in politics from the University of York in England and a master’s and PhD in counseling psychology from Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts."
