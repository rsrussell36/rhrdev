post_content = "With the disturbing events of the past week in the U.S., I write with a heavy heart and lots of anger and frustration. Across the country, people are horrified by the recent killings of three African Americans: Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and George Floyd. And these are only a few of the most recent deaths to cause particular anguish among those who far too long have endured indignity after indignity. As I have reflected over the past few days about the unnecessary, brutal, and hatred-driven murder of George Floyd, I try to comprehend how this happened, and continues to happen, in a so-called evolved society. The expanding protests and unrest across the U.S. are symbolic of a huge cry for help and of a need for something to change. This never-ending racism and unnecessary police violence against people of color need to stop. We need leaders who are aware, empathetic, and trustworthy now more than ever. We all need to do better—policymakers, police organizations, and leaders like you and me. This is not a political issue; it’s a humanity issue, and if we can’t get this right, the pain and suffering will be endless. I don’t pretend to have all the answers to extinguish hatred and deep-seated racism, but I do know <a href=\"https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/\">we all have a role to help educate and change the world</a> through our personal lives and the work we do at RHR.

RHR condemns racism, oppression, and senseless violence targeted toward minorities. I can’t tell you what to do during these times, but taking constructive action in your own way and taking some responsibility to have uncomfortable, open conversations about what is currently happening with colleagues, friends, and family would be a productive start. I have to imagine this is also weighing heavy within your own organizations. This generation and the generations that follow are key to helping break this long-standing string of hatred, racism, and targeted violence toward people of color in the U.S. In times like this, it is difficult to feel optimistic, and it is too easy to feel hopeless and give up. We cannot let that happen. Being courageous and standing up for human rights is of paramount importance. Let’s do what we can individually and collectively to help eradicate this senseless hatred and violence.
