post_content = "<span>DeeDee Lewis is a project coordinator on the Executive Bench team, ensuring the timely facilitation of large-scale projects. As a former scheduler for a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, DeeDee possesses a keen ability to keep more than one project running without letting details slip through the cracks (though her role as a mother of four daughters can also take credit for that). </span>

<span>During her time in Washington, D.C., DeeDee worked closely with the congressmember’s press secretary, which influenced her decision to pursue a Master’s degree in marketing. She then worked for 10 years in marketing and advertising, first as a marketing manager for an established automotive parts company and then as an account executive on the agency side.  DeeDee’s work is largely motivated by her ability to internally improve processes for increased value and efficiency, which ultimately helps Executive Bench deliver the highest-caliber services to clients. She prides herself on her ability to offer her clients and colleagues clear communication, excellent coordinating services, and relationships built on trust. </span>

<span>DeeDee is known for having a good head on her shoulders and approaching problems with humor and grace. When she’s not working, you can find her on the tennis court, watching sci-fi movies, at the beach, or spending time with her four teenage daughters and her husband, as well as her two cats.</span>"
