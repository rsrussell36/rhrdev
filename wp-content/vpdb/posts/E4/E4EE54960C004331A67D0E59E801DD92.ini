For over 25  years, she has cultivated a wealth of experience with the firm, serving a diverse range of clients across industries including manufacturing, consumer goods, energy, financial services, healthcare, insurance, professional associations, real estate, and retail.

Cara’s focus is understanding the individual in the context of the broader system in which they reside. She is particularly skilled at synthesizing complex information and data to support a robust understanding of people and organizations. Cara is highly adept at working with senior teams, helping them reach new heights of performance by providing a clear picture of strengths and gaps and guiding teams toward practical improvements that will impact their effectiveness. She has led complex, often-challenging CEO succession projects, helping businesses to make the right leadership choices for their people, their stakeholders and their long-term strategic goals. She enjoys working with executives to support their development, building authentic relationships with a direct yet supportive approach.

Comfortable with change and complexity, Cara is often brought in on challenging, team-oriented projects. Without requiring much context, she is able to draw on her deep experience and quickly  establish the information she requires to have meaningful impact.  She is often found asking in-depth questions about her clients’ industries, building a vision of the work to be done and how she can help leaders  achieve their full potential.

Prior to joining RHR, Cara received her PhD in clinical psychology from Indiana University. She earned her bachelor’s degree in psychology from the State University of New York, Albany. Cara is a member of the American Psychological Association and Division 13 of the Society of Consulting Psychology.

Outside of work, Cara enjoys being in nature, and can often be found hiking and practicing yoga. Curiosity is a driving force in Cara’s life. She especially enjoys traveling and exploring new places, as well as the opportunity to learn about different industries and new trends that impact her clients."
