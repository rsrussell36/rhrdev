post_content = "A talent-leadership executive with 20 years of industry experience, Cristina Jimenez can be described as a complex problem solver with heart. She applies her expertise to collaboratively build global talent experiences and executive leadership teams for a wide range of Fortune 100 clients in the life science, technology, and private equity spaces. Simultaneously, Cristina spearheads diversity, inclusion, and belonging initiatives, both internally and for her clients.

Cristina’s professional achievements include advising leaders on how to scale organizations by building high-performing teams and create cultures where innovation and agility thrive as well as shaping dynamic, results-driven leaders for multibillion-dollar companies.

Unapologetically bold, Cristina also possesses an expert ability to guide leaders through challenging political and business-oriented situations. She is well-versed in creating a safe space for difficult and uncomfortable conversations that are vital in producing positive change.

Cristina prides herself on her ability to scale external organizations alongside RHR’s own client accounts. For her, building long-lasting relationships not only with her clients but also within her own organization is exceptionally rewarding.

As the head of RHR’s own diversity-and-inclusion efforts, Cristina is a staunch advocate for those who go virtually unseen, both in life and the workplace. She is the mother of a multiply-disabled daughter who has taught her to, above all, do everything with love. This mantra has become a guiding principle to her work. For her, helping clients solve challenges to make a meaningful difference is the ultimate reward.

Prior to entering the corporate world, Cristina spent years in change management, working directly with employees to understand how they experienced leadership in the workplace. Armed with this insight, she transitioned to working with C-suite executives, helping leaders succeed in making crucial talent decisions and, ultimately, cultivating inclusive workplace cultures in their own organizations.

Cristina earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Northeastern University and dual master’s degrees in sociology and business research from Stanford University. When she’s not working, she enjoys being outside on a bicycle or in her garden and spending time with her family."
