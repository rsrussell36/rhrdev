post_content = "<span>Pablo Gora is a consultant for the Executive Bench practice. With a background in organizational change, performance management, and DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion), Pablo applies his talents primarily to leadership assessment and coaching. He uses his unique skills to help executives create real impact and scale to positions of greater scope and complexity. He conducts thoughtful and analysis-oriented interviews with clients ranging from Fortune 50 companies to dynamic startups, having previously worked with larger organizations such as UPS and The Home Depot. </span>

<span>While coaching, Pablo’s favorite thing is watching those “ah-ha” moments, as he leads clients towards their opportunities for improvement, development, and growth. Pablo’s approach is authentic and honest, grounded in his empathetic qualities and genuine desire to see people achieve their full potential. Pablo’s natural capacity for dedication and discipline enables him to perform outstandingly, and this is also reflected in his life outside of work; he’s passionate about strength training and nutrition, and is always pushing himself to develop and learn more. However, he’ll take an occasional break to watch a good movie! </span>"
