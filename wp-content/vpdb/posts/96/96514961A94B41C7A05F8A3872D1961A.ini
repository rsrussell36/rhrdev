post_content = "Nick Twyman is a partner at RHR International. He brings a strong track record in leadership development, built after a 20-year corporate career as a leader in the line. With a commercial mindset and curiosity about his clients’ markets and operating models, Nick can always be trusted to develop leaders and Boards of Directors within the broader context of their company and strategy.

With considerable commercial and executive coaching experience, Nick performs assessments with agility and ease, creating in-depth psychological profiles. The insights from these assessments inform clear viewpoints into strengths and development gaps, which Nick uses to help his range of clients across industries to reach new levels of achievement, both personal and on a broader strategic level. He works with businesses of all sizes, recently focusing especially on entrepreneurial hypergrowth firms. He helps these clients utilize their passion and drive to build robust teams and align around a clear articulation of their strategy. This enables them to scale, develop their culture, and become fit for purpose. Shifts in market structure, buyer needs and buying behaviour are elements that Nick pays attention to when helping leaders reflect on their go to market approach and how to lead and engage with their organisations to improve their management style.

Given the immense impact leadership has on society and its respective ecosystems, Nick is passionate about enhancing the quality of leadership around the world. He believes in the need for more enlightened leaders and advocates that good leaders are guided by principles that are founded on a strong ethical and moral compass, treating people fairly and making sure their businesses leave a net positive impact on the world.

Prior to joining RHR, Nick set up his own executive coaching and team development practice across a blue chip client base. Nick received a bachelor’s degree (Hons) from Aston University. He is a master practitioner in neurolinguistic programming and a fellow of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. He is a member of the Institute of Directors, the Association for Coaching, and the International Coach Federation

With a large family, including his wife, four daughters and three grandchildren (so far!), Nick is often busy exploring the countryside around his home. He lives in a historical 16th century cottage, and as a steward of this, he is constantly working on its maintenance and enhancement. He is passionate about fitness and traveling to discover new cultures. He is a firm believer that there is a spiritual richness to understanding how different parts of the planet operate and he enjoys exploring this whenever possible, with his family by his side."
