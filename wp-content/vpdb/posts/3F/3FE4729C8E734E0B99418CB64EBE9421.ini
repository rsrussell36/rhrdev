post_content = "Dr. Grant Levitan is a Senior Partner based in Chicago. His work facilitates organic and authentic growth in leaders, enabling them to achieve new levels of performance and personal effectiveness. As a Senior Partner with over 35 years of experience in leadership consulting, he delivers unparalleled wisdom, guidance and strategic expertise.

Well known for his advisory work with senior level executives, Grant is highly experienced across industries, including manufacturing, energy, pharmaceuticals, and private equity. As global trends emerge, Grant helps leaders in these industries to strategize and enhance the way that they lead, creating effective future-proofed change across their organizations. He can often be found applying his talents to C-level succession planning. He conceptualises and leads multi-year executive development and succession planning programs with a highly considered approach. This includes building a model of the ideal executive for the specific client corporation, and then creating a multi-faceted and customized assessment and development plan.

Grant’s impact echoes down into the very structure of RHR International. He led the London office from 1991 to 1996, creating rapid growth and a fast turnaround. He also led the Central Region for the North American practice from 2002 to 2011. He continues to develop and craft projects alongside clients and execute those with the RHR International team.

Intrinsic to his approach is a simple three-pronged goal; to grow clients, colleagues and community. He is a true egalitarian and believes that leadership occurs at all levels in organizations. Everyone has room to grow in the dimension of leadership, and it is with this approach that Grant begins to build relationships and create real change - leading with ideas. The power of purpose is also central to Grant’s philosophy. He helps leaders find and leverage their purpose, translating it to growth in a meaningful direction.

Grant is consistently fascinated by new and diverse experiences across businesses and industries. He has an eye for the complex and the compelling, and building leaders who can lead across various contexts. Prior to joining RHR, Grant held numerous research and training positions at the University of Illinois at Chicago and served as a community mental health consultant in Ohio and Colorado.

Staying active and enjoying the great outdoors are core elements of Grant’s life outside of work. He is fun-loving, gracious and incredibly curious about all things. He enjoys skiing, running, swimming and biking. Grant also currently serves on the board of the Illinois Manufacturing Foundation, a not for profit that teaches computer-aided machinery technology to the disadvantaged and undereducated and places them in well-paying jobs."
