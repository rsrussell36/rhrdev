post_content = "Katelyn Aase has been a project coordinator at RHR International since 2013. Her expertise covers two main areas and bridges the gap between project coordination and client-facing work—managing both her project coordinator role and key responsibilities in RHR’s Objective Testing Center of Excellence (OTCOE).

When working on the OTCOE, Katelyn assists with executive assessment and development engagements by analyzing Hogan Assessment results. She specializes in interpreting the results of the Hogan Assessment and writing clear, insightful summaries of the results in order to help consultants continuously improve the way that they assess and coach clients. She also uses her Hogan certification to help with internal recruiting efforts, providing insight on candidates’ fits to both the roles that they are being considered for and the culture at RHR International.

As a project coordinator, Katelyn is particularly well-known for being able to build meaningful relationships with clients. She consistently oversees the tracking and management of key project deliverables while also ensuring that consultants are able to easily connect with clients and make an impact. When project managing at offsite meetings, Katelyn is trusted as a technological expert in programs such as Stormboard, which she leverages to display key insights and outcomes.

Driven by helping people, Katelyn always tries to make a difference in everything she does. She enjoys creating structure out of potentially ambiguous or uncertain situations and enhancing preexisting processes. She is trusted to help ensure that teams have what they need to run at peak efficiency and productivity.

Prior to joining RHR, Katelyn worked in healthcare consulting as a project manager. Based in Canada, she is passionate about animal welfare. She has a rescue dog and is committed to fostering litters of puppies with her partner. Katelyn enjoys being active and can often be found backpacking, hiking, and running."
