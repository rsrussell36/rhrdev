post_content = "Myongii Shephard is a Project Coordinator at RHR International. She is well-known for her coordination capabilities, relationship building and high levels of organization on large projects. The skills she has developed over her time at RHR have successfully empowered her to branch out and develop her expertise in new areas. She has worked across Sales and Business Development and is now engaged in the Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (DI&amp;B) arm of the business.

Within her DI&amp;B work, Myongii is particularly adept at performing in-depth research into employee experience, ensuring that RHR consistently weaves its DI&amp;B principles into the broader structure of the firm as well as into client work. Myongii is motivated every day by her fascination with company culture and the importance of empowering people to truly be themselves at their workplace. She helps support any change management in this area, building a firm that is culturally fluent, highly responsive and socially responsible.

Prior to joining RHR, Myongii worked in law firms as an administrative assistant. She pivoted to RHR and joined as an office manager, where she exercised her client-facing experience and ability to manage everything from calendars to events. She then worked as an administrative assistant before being promoted to project coordinator.

Myongii emphasizes the importance of relationships in everything she does. Connections with colleagues and clients are imperative to project success and workplace engagement. Her biggest value is transparency, which she believes lends itself to trust. Trust, in turn, forms the foundation of an honest and authentic relationship. This is reflected in Myongii’s personal life, as she brings her signature empathy and thoughtfulness to her friendships and family, too. When she’s not at work, Myongii can be found enjoying her home city of New York, where she was born and raised."
