post_content = "<span>Elizabeth Raczyla is Executive Bench’s in-house lead generator, better known as the Client Services Lead. She is the bridge between prospective clients and Executive Bench, leveraging her deep-rooted background in B2B and pharmaceutical sales to offer services to new clients with professionalism, authenticity, and a customer-oriented approach. </span>

<span>Given her extensive experience in sales and marketing, Elizabeth has an inherent ability to reign command over every aspect of the sales cycle, from identifying prospective matches and generating leads to garnering interest and closing the loop. As the first point of contact with new and prospective clients, Elizabeth acts as Executive’s Bench “first impression.” Being able to provide clients with solutions that ultimately improve how they work is truly rewarding for Elizabeth. She is a strong believer in commitment, honesty, and transparency in communication — she always tells it how it is, armed with an analytical and valuable solution to every problem. Her work is driven by her dedication to bringing her clients the best solutions possible, introducing them to opportunities that they may never have previously known without her. </span>

<span>Given her ability to perform in fast-paced environments (and especially given her role as a mother), Elizabeth is a master multi-tasker, keen at navigating the many tabs open in her work life with grace and poise. When she isn’t working, Elizabeth can be found going on adventures with her two sons, spending time with her cat, or reading an exciting memoir or biography. </span>"
