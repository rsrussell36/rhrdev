post_content = "<span>Eden Abrahams is a partner at RHR International and leads the firm’s Founder’s Journey offering, a unique support system designed to give founders and CEOs the right tools to navigate the chaotic scale-up landscape. Drawing on her executive coaching expertise and diverse background in communications and international business, she empowers senior executives and leadership teams to strengthen and expand their capabilities.  Eden is also a skilled assessor, facilitator, and business transformation advisor for organizations ranging from start-ups and boutique partnerships to Fortune 100 corporations.</span>

<span>Energetic and extroverted, Eden listens deeply and creates space for her clients to reflect, recharge, and gain fresh insights. She brings both candor and compassion to her work, whether she’s helping C-suite executives and rising leaders define what holistic growth and professional success looks like or collaborating with teams to build healthier dynamics. Once they’ve identified the desired outcomes, Eden is as focused on ensuring that the journey is a positive one as she is on driving results.</span>

<span>Her own multifaceted professional background gives Eden firsthand insight into the challenges leaders face in both rapidly-scaling start-ups and large, established companies. She began her career in public relations, then moved into macro political-risk consulting, where she served as an advisor to banks and hedge funds navigating the transition from individual European currencies to the euro. After a stint in corporate communications at Merrill Lynch, she became a partner at a specialized communications firm, providing strategic guidance to companies involved in special situations such as merger and acquisition transactions, litigation, and management transitions. Prior to joining RHR, Eden was the managing partner of her own consulting practice, Clear Path Executive Coaching, in New York City.</span>

<span>As a result of her varied professional experiences, Eden is well-equipped to work with a diverse range of companies and leaders. She is adept at guiding them through high-risk, challenging scenarios. She also understands the unique challenges women leaders face in the business arena. In addition to her work at RHR, she is a founding guide at Chief, a private network for women executives, where she facilitates a CEO peer learning group.</span>

<span>Eden earned a bachelor’s degree in political science and Italian from Northwestern University, a master’s degree in European studies and international economics from the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, and a master’s degree in professional development (executive coaching) from Middlesex University London. When she’s not working, Eden enjoys spending time with her three children, traveling, cooking for a crowd, and reading. She also loves music and exercising, a remnant of her days as an aspiring ballerina. You can often find her hiking in the Hudson Valley if it’s not too cold—or staying inside in front of a fire if it is. She is a passionate board member of Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America, a nonprofit dedicated to helping exceptional young people from under-resourced backgrounds achieve success at selective colleges through graduation and beyond.</span>
