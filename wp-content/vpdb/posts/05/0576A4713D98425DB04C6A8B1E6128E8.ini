                                                RHR International uses cookies (small, often encrypted, text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device) and similar technologies (“Cookies”) to provide our Sites and help collect data. This Cookies Policy explains how we use Cookies to collect information about the way you use our Sites, and how you can control them.                                             
                                            How We Use Cookies 
                                                We use Cookies to track how you use our Sites by providing usage statistics. Cookies are also used to deliver Company information (including updates) and allow product authentication to you based upon your browsing history and previous visits to the Sites. Information supplied to us using cookies helps us to provide a better online experience to our visitors and users and send marketing communications to them, as the case may be. While this information on its own may not constitute your “personal information”, we may combine the information we collect via Cookies with personal information that we have collected from you to learn more about how you use our Sites to improve them.                                            
                                            Types of Cookies
                We use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them). To make it easier for you to understand why we need them, the Cookies we use on our Sites can be grouped into the following categories:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Strictly Necessary: These Cookies are necessary for the Sites to work properly. They include any essential authentication and authorization cookies for our Sites.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Functionality: These Cookies enable technical performance and allow us to “remember” the choices you make while browsing our Sites, including any preferences you set. They also include sign in and authentication cookies and IDs that enable you to return without additional sign-in.</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Performance/Analytical: These Cookies allow us to collect certain information about how you navigate the Sites. They help us understand which areas you use and what we can do to improve them.</p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Targeting: These Cookies are used to deliver relevant information related to our Sites to an identified machine or other device (not a named or otherwise identifiable person) which has previously been used to visit our Sites. Some of these types of Cookies on our Sites are operated by third parties with our permission and are used to identify advertising sources that are effectively driving customers to our Sites. </p>

                                            Cookies Set by Third Party Services 
                                                <p>To enhance our content and to deliver a better online experience for our users, we sometimes embed images and videos from other websites on the Sites. You may be presented with Cookies from these third-party websites. Please note that we do not control these Cookies. The privacy practices of these third parties will be governed by the parties’ own privacy statements or policies. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by these third parties, using cookies or other means. You should consult and review the relevant third-party privacy statement or policy for information on how these cookies are used and how you can control them.</p>
                <p>We also use Google, a third-party analytics provider, to collect information about Sites usage and the users of the Sites, including demographic and interest-level information. Google uses cookies in order to collect demographic and interest-level information and usage information from users that visit the Sites, including information about the pages where users enter and exit the Sites and what pages users view on the Sites, time spent, browser, operating system, and IP address. Cookies allow Google to recognize a user when a user visits the Sites and when the user visits other websites. Google uses the information it collects from the Sites and other websites to share with us and other website operators’ information about users including age range, gender, geographic regions, general interests, and details about devices used to visit websites and purchase items. We do not link information we receive from Google with any of your personally identifiable information. For more information regarding Google’s use of cookies, and collection and use of information, see the Google Privacy Policy (available at 
                https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en). If you would like to opt out of Google Analytics tracking, please visit the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on (available at

                                            Social Sharing 
                                                We also embed social sharing icons throughout our Sites. These sharing options are designed to enable users to easily share content from our Sites with their friends using a variety of different social networks. If you choose to connect using a social networking or similar service, we may receive and store authentication information from that service to enable you to log in and other information that you may choose to share when you connect with these services. These services may collect information such as the web pages you visited and IP addresses, and may set cookies to enable features to function properly. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by these third parties. You should review the privacy statements or policies applicable to the third-party services you connect to, use, or access. If you do not want your personal information shared with your social media account provider or other users of the social media service, please do not connect your social media account with your account for the Sites and do not participate in social sharing through the Sites.                                             
                                                RHR International web pages may use other technologies such as web beacons to help deliver cookies on our Sites and count users who have visited those Sites. We also may include web beacons in 
                our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open and act on them as well as for statistical purposes. 
                In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, our services can also use other similar technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This is typically done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally.                                            
                Cookies can be controlled, blocked or restricted through your web
                browser settings. Information on how to do this can be found within the Help section of your browser. All Cookies are browser specific. Therefore, if you use multiple browsers or devices to access websites, you will need to manage your cookie preferences across these environments. 
                If you are using a mobile device to access the Sites, you will need to refer to your instruction manual or other help/settings resource to find out how you can control cookies on your device.

                    <p>Please note: If you restrict, disable or block any or all Cookies from your web browser or mobile or other device, the Sites may not operate properly, and you may not have access to our Sites available through the Sites. RHR International shall not be liable for any impossibility to use the Sites or degraded functioning thereof, where such are caused by your settings and choices regarding cookies.

                    <p>Do Not Track: Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operators, including RHR International, do not respond to DNT signals.</p>
