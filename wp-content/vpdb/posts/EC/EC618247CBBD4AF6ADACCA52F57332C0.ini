She serves as a critical liaison between clients and consultants, overseeing the management and successful facilitation of project timelines, scheduling, and other tasks vital to driving RHR’s leadership solutions offerings forward.

Organized and dependable, Lisa is well-known for her detail-oriented work style, which enables her to effectively manage the seamless flow of multiple projects at once.
