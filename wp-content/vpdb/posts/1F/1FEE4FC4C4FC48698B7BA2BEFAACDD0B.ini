post_content = "Change begins at the top. Most seasoned executives have likely been a part of several episodes of significant organizational change. Mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, system implementations are all examples of complex and difficult tasks requiring disciplined, sophisticated leadership. But few executives have pleasant memories of these “opportunities.”

More often than not everyone involved had hoped that things would have gone better. A project that should have gone smoothly suddenly stalled. What looked neat and orderly on the flip chart felt like trench warfare during implementation. Sometimes the problems are blamed on design issues, sometimes on resistance from employees who have to make change work. But often lurking behind these excuses is a failure of leadership to cultivate change in both itself and others."
