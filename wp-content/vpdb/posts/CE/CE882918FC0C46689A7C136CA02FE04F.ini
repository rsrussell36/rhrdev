RHR International will treat access to the Sites through your account credentials as authorized by you.

We may suspend your use of all or part of the Sites without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security. If you believe that information you provided to us is no longer secure, please notify us immediately using the contact information provided below. <br /><br />If we become aware of a breach that affects the security of your personal information, we will provide you with notice as required by applicable law. To the extent permitted by applicable law, RHR International will provide any such notice that RHR International must provide to you at your account’s email address. By using the Sites, you agree to accept notice electronically. <br /><br /><em>Storage and Transfer of Personal Information</em> <br /><br />Personal data collected by RHR International may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States or in any other country where RHR International, its affiliates or contractors maintain facilities.

If your personal information is no longer necessary for the legal or business purposes for which it is processed, we will generally destroy or anonymize that information. </p>                                            
                                            YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION
                                                <p>RHR International respects your right to access and control your personal information. You have choices about the data we collect. When you are asked to provide personal information that is not necessary for the purposes of providing you with our Sites, you may decline. However, if you choose not to provide data that is necessary to provide a Service, you may not have access to certain features, Sites. <br /><br />We aim to keep all personal information that we hold accurate, complete and up-to-date. While we will use our best efforts to do so, we encourage you to tell us if you change your contact details. If you believe that the information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or out-of-date, please contact <a href=\"mailto:dataprotection@rhrinternational.com\">dataprotection@rhrinternational.com</a> or call (877) 888-0109. <br /><br /><b>Access to personal information:</b> In some jurisdictions, you have the right to request access to your personal information. In these cases, we will comply, subject to any relevant legal requirements and exemptions, including identity verification procedures. Before providing data to you, we will ask for proof of identity and sufficient information about your interaction with us so that we can locate any relevant data. We may also charge you a fee for providing you with a copy of your data (except where this is not permissible under local law). <br /><br /><b>Correction and deletion:</b> In some jurisdictions, you have the right to correct or amend your personal information if it is inaccurate or requires updating. You may also have the right to request deletion of your personal information. Please note that such a request could be refused because your personal information is required to provide you with the products or services you requested, e.g. to deliver a product or send an invoice to your email address, or that it is required by the applicable law. <br /><br /><b>Marketing preferences:</b> If you have provided us with your contact information, we may, subject to any applicable Spam Act or similar regulation, contact you via e-mail, postal mail or telephone about RHR International products, services and events that may be of interest to you, including our newsletter. <br /><br />E-mail communications you receive from RHR International will generally provide an unsubscribe link allowing you to opt-out of receiving future e-mail or to change your contact preferences. Please remember that even if you opt out of receiving marketing emails, we may still send you important Service information related to your accounts and subscriptions. <br /><br />You can also request changes to your account by contacting RHR International by emailing <a href=\"mailto:dataprotection@rhrinternational.com\">dataprotection@rhrinternational.com</a>.</p>                                            
                                            COOKIES &#038; SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
                                                <p>RHR International uses cookies (small, often encrypted, text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device) and similar technologies (“Cookies”) to provide our Sites and help collect data. This Cookies Policy explains how we use Cookies to collect information about the way you use our Sites, and how you can control them. <br /><br />How We Use Cookies <br /><br />We use Cookies to track how you use our Sites by providing usage statistics. Cookies are also used to deliver Company information (including updates) and allow product authentication to you based upon your browsing history and previous visits to the Sites. Information supplied to us using cookies helps us to provide a better online experience to our visitors and users and send marketing communications to them, as the case may be. While this information on its own may not constitute your “personal information”, we may combine the information we collect via Cookies with personal information that we have collected from you to learn more about how you use our Sites to improve them. <br /><br />Types of Cookies <br /><br />We use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your device until you delete them). To make it easier for you to understand why we need them, the Cookies we use on our Sites can be grouped into the following categories:</p><ul><li>Strictly Necessary: These Cookies are necessary for the Sites to work properly. They include any essential authentication and authorization cookies for our Sites.</li><li>Functionality: These Cookies enable technical performance and allow us to “remember” the choices you make while browsing our Sites, including any preferences you set. They also include sign-in and authentication cookies and IDs that enable you to return without additional sign-in.</li><li>Performance/Analytical: These Cookies allow us to collect certain information about how you navigate the Sites. They help us understand which areas you use and what we can do to improve them.</li><li>Targeting: These Cookies are used to deliver relevant information related to our Sites to an identified machine or other device (not a named or otherwise identifiable person) which has previously been used to visit our Sites. Some of these types of Cookies on our Sites are operated by third parties with our permission and are used to identify advertising sources that are effectively driving customers to our Sites.</li></ul><p>Cookies Set by Third Party Services <br /><br />To enhance our content and to deliver a better online experience for our users, we sometimes embed images and videos from other websites on the Sites. You may be presented with Cookies from these third-party websites. Please note that we do not control these Cookies. The privacy practices of these third parties will be governed by the parties’ own privacy statements or policies. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by these third parties, using cookies or other means. You should consult and review the relevant third-party privacy statement or policy for information on how these cookies are used and how you can control them. <br /><br />We also use Google, a third-party analytics provider, to collect information about Sites usage and the users of the Sites, including demographic and interest-level information. Google uses cookies in order to collect demographic and interest-level information and usage information from users that visit the Sites, including information about the pages where users enter and exit the Sites and what pages users view on the Sites, time spent, browser, operating system, and IP address. Cookies allow Google to recognize a user when a user visits the Sites and when the user visits other websites. Google uses the information it collects from the Sites and other websites to share with us and other website operators’ information about users including age range, gender, geographic regions, general interests, and details about devices used to visit websites and purchase items. We do not link information we receive from Google with any of your personally identifiable information. For more information regarding Google’s use of cookies, and collection and use of information, see the Google Privacy Policy (available at <a href=\"https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en\">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a>). If you would like to opt out of Google Analytics tracking, please visit the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on (available at <a href=\"https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout\">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>). <br /><br />Social Sharing <br /><br />We also embed social sharing icons throughout our Sites. These sharing options are designed to enable users to easily share content from our Sites with their friends using a variety of different social networks. If you choose to connect using a social networking or similar service, we may receive and store authentication information from that service to enable you to log in and other information that you may choose to share when you connect with these services. These services may collect information such as the web pages you visited and IP addresses, and may set cookies to enable features to function properly. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by these third parties. You should review the privacy statements or policies applicable to the third-party services you connect to, use, or access. If you do not want your personal information shared with your social media account provider or other users of the social media service, please do not connect your social media account with your account for the Sites and do not participate in social sharing through the Sites. <br /><br />Other Similar Technologies <br /><br />RHR International web pages may use other technologies such as web beacons to help deliver cookies on our Sites and count users who have visited those Sites. We also may include web beacons in our promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether you open and act on them as well as for statistical purposes. <br /><br />In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, our services can also use other similar technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This is typically done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally. <br /><br />How to Control and Delete Cookies <br /><br />Cookies can be controlled, blocked or restricted through your web browser settings. Information on how to do this can be found within the Help section of your browser. All Cookies are browser specific. Therefore, if you use multiple browsers or devices to access websites, you will need to manage your cookie preferences across these environments. <br /><br />If you are using a mobile device to access the Sites, you will need to refer to your instruction manual or other help/settings resource to find out how you can control cookies on your device. <br /><br />Please note: If you restrict, disable or block any or all Cookies from your web browser or mobile or other device, the Sites may not operate properly, and you may not have access to our Sites available through the Sites. RHR International shall not be liable for any impossibility to use the Sites or degraded functioning thereof, where such are caused by your settings and choices regarding cookies. <br /><br />To learn more about cookies and web beacons, visit <a href=\"http://www.allaboutcookies.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. <br /><br />Do Not Track: Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operators, including RHR International, do not respond to DNT signals.</p>

California residents have specific rights regarding their personal information, including a right to access specific or categories of information RHR International may collect, to have such information deleted, to receive a copy of such information, and to not be discriminated against by RHR International for exercising the foregoing rights. <br /><br />California residents can contact us with questions or comments about this notice, the ways in which we collect, use, and disclose your information described in this Privacy Policy, your choices and rights regarding such use, or if you wish to exercise your rights under California law through a “Verifiable Personal Information Request”. To submit a Verifiable Personal Information Request, please contact us or have your authorized agent contact us at <a href=\"mailto:dataprotection@rhrinternational.com\">dataprotection@rhrinternational.com</a> or call (877) 888-0109. For submissions via email please use the downloadable <a href=\"https://www.rhrinternational.com/pdf/RHR_Verifiable_Consumer_Request_Form.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">RHR Verifiable Consumer Request Form</a>. Under California Law, we must verify your identity prior to responding to your Verifiable Personal Information Request. You may have to provide us with identity information, as described in the California Consumer Privacy Act, to enable us to verify your identity. Please let us know if you encounter accessibility barriers with regard to this Privacy Policy. <br /><br /><em>California Shine the Light Law:</em> California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users who are California residents to obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of third parties to whom we have disclosed personal information (if any) for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and you wish to make such a request, please send an e-mail with “California Privacy Rights” in the subject line to dataprotection@rhrinternational.com or write us at: RHR International LLP, 233 South Wacker Drive, 95th Floor, Chicago, IL 60606. <br /><br />California Minors: While the Sites is not intended for anyone under the age of 18, if you are a California resident who is under age 18 and you are unable to remove publicly-available content that you have submitted to us, you may request removal by contacting us at: <a href=\"mailto:dataprotection@rhrinternational.com\">dataprotection@rhrinternational.com</a>. When requesting removal, you must be specific about the information you want removed and provide us with specific information, such as the URL for each page where the information was entered, so that we can find it. We are not required to remove any content or information that: (1) federal or state law requires us or a third party to maintain; (2) was not posted by you; (3) is anonymized so that you cannot be identified; (4) you don’t follow our instructions for removing or requesting removal; or (5) you received compensation or other consideration for providing the Content or information. Removal of your content or information from the Sites does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information from our systems or the systems of our service providers. We are not required to delete the content or information posted by you; our obligations under California law are satisfied so long as we anonymize the content or information or render it invisible to other users and the public. </p>
