post_content = "<span>As a consultant for Executive Bench, Brett Williams leverages his unique background in counseling and psychology to support his clients in shaping impactful leaders. He works with organizations across industries, ranging from manufacturing and technology to healthcare to food and beverage companies, helping their executives develop critical leadership skills and identify their opportunities for growth. </span>

<span>Towards the start of his working life and prior to entering the world of leadership development, Brett worked in restaurants for 13 years as a chef, sharpening his ability to work efficiently and diligently in fast-paced environments. His time in the service industry also enabled him to acquire an invaluable skill: the ability to work seamlessly with people of diverse and varying backgrounds. It comes as no surprise, then, that treating others with respect, dignity, and empathy forms a vital part of Brett’s core values, which he applies to his work every day. He is inherently observant and a sharp listener — his work is more than just a job, and his clients’ success is truly paramount to him. Additionally, being able to connect with clients on an individual level and watching large impact stem from seemingly small changes is extremely rewarding for him. </span>

<span>Outside of work, you can find Brett with his family and his dog, enjoying the outdoors, listening to podcasts — and, of course, in the kitchen, cooking something absolutely amazing and pairing it with a bottle of wine. </span>"
