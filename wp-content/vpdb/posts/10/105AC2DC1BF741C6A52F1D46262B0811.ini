post_content = "Dr. Paul Winum is a Senior Partner and the Co-Head of Board &amp; CEO services at RHR International. He also plays a vital role in supporting consultants in the field and working directly with clients, as well as continuously spearheading new research in governance, board evaluations and C-Suite succession planning.

Paul is one of the nation’s preeminent specialists in the areas of CEO succession and board evaluation. He has empowered more than one hundred and fifty companies across twenty different sectors during his time at RHR International, and leverages over thirty years of experience in the leadership consulting space. Notably, Paul has worked with financial services clients over multiple-year engagements, leading programs focused on developing high-potential leaders that create a positive impact on their organizations, and subsequently the world. His strategies push leaders to establish organizational cultures that will maximize the potential of their people, both on a collective and individual level.

One of Paul’s main motivators at work is the difference he can make for others. Every strong CEO, board and executive team impacts thousands of people, from employees through to shareholders. Using behavioral psychology and targeted development, Paul is able to make a real impact on the world, developing well-led organizations across industries.

These central values echo clearly throughout Paul’s life. From achieving his Bachelor’s in Sociology and Psychology at Columbia University, he attended Notre Dame where he got a Masters and PHD in counselling psychology. After this, Paul worked as COO of a large nonprofit operating out of New York. He is also the founder of  a nonprofit that is still flourishing thirty years later. In his work with RHR International, Paul’s impact is woven throughout the business: he helped the firm to restructure and develop the practice areas seen today, with particular focus on board services. He is also currently a frequent contributor to the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Corporate Board Member</i> and <i>Chief Executive </i>magazines.

Outside of work, Paul follows his natural curiosity and dives into a diverse range of interests. He is also an avid golfer and sports enthusiast following his athletic career at Columbia where he lettered in basketball and football. He can also often be found enjoying great theatre, art, film, food and wine."
