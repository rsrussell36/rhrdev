post_content = "Kristin Lee is a project coordinator at RHR International, serving as fundamental support to RHR’s senior consultants and clients. Leveraging her proactivity and organizational skills, Kristin also spearheads several other critical initiatives, including consultant recruiting, talent development, and internal learning and development.

As a project coordinator, Kristin plays a critical role in overseeing the completion of large-scale projects, including senior team effectiveness and executive integration work, alongside RHR’s consultants. With a sharp eye for even the smallest of details, Kristin ensures the smooth and timely facilitation of high-quality deliverables, managing statements of works, project trackers, and data reports to ensure each milestone meets its deadline. Internally, Kristin also manages the integration of new hires, working closely with RHR’s recruiting team to ensure effective transitions for onboarding team members.

No matter what capacity she’s working in, Kristin strives to build personal relationships with her colleagues and clients. She embodies both an easygoing and hardworking approach and is guided by values of honesty and continuous learning. Kristin takes every opportunity she can to expand her knowledge base, joining meetings to absorb new ideas from her colleagues to apply to her own work.

Kristin joined RHR after working in IT project coordination and management, collaborating with teams of engineers to oversee the installment of servers for hospitals and other large industrial complexes. She has also worked as a job-cost accountant and project manager in the restoration and remodeling sector. Kristin graduated from Frostburg State University with an undergraduate degree in marketing and finance and an MBA.

When Kristin’s not working, you can usually find her outside hiking (her latest adventure included hiking half of the Colorado trail in two weeks), paddleboarding, snowboarding, and rock climbing. She’s also an avid runner and has been working on running a half-marathon in every state as well as checking breweries off her bucket list while she’s at it. She also values spending time with her husband and young daughter."
