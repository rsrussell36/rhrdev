		<content:encoded><![CDATA[According to best practices in board evaluations, you should hire an external expert to conduct the process at least every two to three years. This helps uncover subtle issues and opportunities, increase candor, and reduce the risk of a check-the-box approach by introducing different questions, process, and perspective. We are starting to see a similar trend in managing CEO performance. While all boards conduct some version of an annual CEO performance review, there is a growing realization that leveraging a different approach through an external party at least every two to three years brings value.

The challenges and opportunities that today’s CEOs navigate continue to grow in complexity and pace of change. While a standard approach to CEO performance will highlight core areas, the process is less likely to surface more subtle insights. These weak signals are bits of information that can get lost in the noise or filtered out by assumptions unless one deliberately looks for the patterns and the implications. They represent the gift of early warning for those fortunate enough to be listening. In the CEO context, the earlier these issues are recognized and discussed, the more options are available to the CEO to redirect or evolve. This helps the board to proactively maximize the CEO’s performance through addressing areas such as the following:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Unforeseen implications of changes in the business model. Boards create a profile for the skills and experience needed in the next CEO based on the company’s strategy and business model. However, once the CEO is in place, the emerging business landscape can require the organization to adapt in order to thrive. Over time, these shifts can create gaps between the type of organization the CEO was selected to lead and the current reality. (For instance, the company may move from a holding company model to a more integrated operating structure, or from a primary focus on one country to a more global footprint. Or, the company may pursue a business opportunity that places it and the CEO more squarely in the spotlight. Each of these changes may require skills that the CEO does not possess to the degree necessary for success.) A candid, early conversation may result in adding an outside hire to the C-suite, proactive development for the CEO, leveraging expertise on the board, or sourcing external advisors. This conversation, left too late, may result in the need to change the CEO.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">CEO resilience. At some point in his or her tenure, a CEO begins to picture life after the role. The timeline for this step tends to stretch or contract depending upon how grueling or sustainable (and meaningful) the top executive’s current experience has been. However, the board is rarely alerted to this accordion effect on the timeline until it has wreaked its havoc. Extended and extensive travel demands or persistent challenges with individual director(s) can make a shortened timeframe more appealing. Surfacing signs of wear and tear on an otherwise successful CEO can spark early conversations that help highlight opportunities to reduce the shredding and extend the tenure of a valued executive.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Stylistic issues. Dynamics between the board and the CEO or between the CEO and the senior leadership team can run below the surface, creating extra noise in the system that draws energy and focus away from what is most important. Surfacing these issues early can help redirect the focus back to where it should be and prevent escalation into much bigger issues. These can revolve around communication styles, information flow, timing, or different reactions to how a given issue was addressed. They tend to be minor but persistent and, unless surfaced and addressed, can hinder candid conversations moving forward.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Questionable behavior. While less common than the headlines may lead one to believe, CEOs can be vulnerable to lapses in judgment, impulsivity, or loss of perspective. This is particularly likely in times of stress or, ironically, substantial success. Surfacing issues that reflect questionable choices in one area can help heighten the need for the board to intervene and to remain vigilant for other signs of risk.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

Recognizing and interpreting weak signals in the context of CEO performance is, in reality, the gift of time and options. Candid conversations that deliver insight and highlight potential blind spots before they become more problematic help a CEO (and the board) bring best performance to the role, the organization, and the stakeholders.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>The conversation in the chairman’s office was serious. Sitting in high-backed leather seats around a highly polished table, we talked about the readiness or not of the business to change. The chairman was concerned, and indeed a little worried. </i>

<i>Rather colorfully, he set the scene. “We’ve had the best mousetrap in the business for 57 years and achieved growth and outstanding levels of profitability. The landscape has changed, and we’ve been too slow to respond. As a result, I’m not sure I’ve got the right people to make the journey.”</i>

This was a global business where long tenure was the norm—where leaders had masses of technical expertise and where the people knew the products really well. They were proud of what they created and achieved over time. There was a “family feel” to the culture with the inevitable “pros and cons” implications.

While the facts here relate to a specific client, this speaks to any organization where growth and scale are high on the agenda. This provides a potent reminder of the steps required to shift an ingrained operating culture and embrace change.

Businesses that have enjoyed “the best mousetrap” always risk getting blindsided. In this case, it would be fair to say the senior leaders running the business wore their cultural clothes with pride. And, with the vast majority having been promoted from within, they were less externally focused, less strategically alert, and less agile. Most had never had the experience of leading a truly transformational change. This was a big problem given the challenges ahead.
<h3></h3>
<h3>Operating culture runs deep</h3>
Deeper down in any business there are always established ways of working; these are no longer challenged but accepted as the way things are done. An often commented-on dynamic in global businesses is the tension between discipline and empowerment. This was symbolic in our case in a few ways. The old leadership regime, quite paternalistic, had tight control of how work got done. Our data showed that the greater the distance from the center, the more people found work arounds—justifying what they were doing as necessary in their local markets. In this context, our task was to identify those leaders who could successfully work <i>with</i> the enterprise and at the same time be <i>accountable</i> for their own results and deliver. We needed to find leaders who were able to understand and role model to the business a new way of working with the center.
<h3></h3>
<h3>Crossing the streams</h3>
Connecting the various workstreams in transformation increases value. However, it can be tempting to sequence the talent workstream once the business agenda is complete. Acting concurrently has benefits both for the business in terms of making timely decisions and also helps shape the specific leadership investigation.

What became clear in this case was that the wide business remit (including “routes to market,” “operational footprint review,” and “new business models”) meant the transformational journey was long term. The result was a state where the business would need to be “always on” for transformation and change. Understanding this informed our approach to assessing “change readiness” and the leadership skills required to be successful. We had to identify those who had the ability to both intellectually and emotionally handle ambiguity and change at speed; not only for themselves, but also to bring people with them as they navigated unchartered waters.
<h3></h3>
<h3>Finding the next generation of talent</h3>
It was critical here to find the good talent further down in the business—those who were not on the radar but who could play a role in the emerging growth strategy. This activity can be costly and take time, two likely reasons not to do it. Therefore, using a time and cost-efficient process is essential. Indeed, our process was not looking simply at potential, our enquiry had to be broader and more business specific. We were looking for talent that showed a readiness in their leadership to scale and take on roles with greater complexity and size. We were looking not only for leaders with ambition, but high levels of resilience to stay the course.
<h3></h3>
<h3>Data-based decisions</h3>
In three months, we had aggregate data to share with the client. This was an important moment in addressing whether they had the leadership horsepower to achieve this transformation or not. The data revealed changes were needed on the top team and the overall leadership profile was not strong. True, the bar had been set high, but in order to take a robust look at all aspects of leadership, it needed to be challenging. And a lower bar is only superseded some time later when the transformation (as always) encounters the inevitable bumps in the road and leadership gets harder.

It is fair to say that the chairman was not completely surprised. However, the results sharpened the focus on what needed to happen next. And, as always, we were also able to surface some unknown talent, in particular a swathe of ready-now leaders who could be utilized straight away in new roles to drive the business forward.
<h3></h3>
<h3>Bottom line:</h3>
When faced with the mousetrap dilemma:
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1">Act on the talent agenda concurrent to the strategy and operational review.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Set a high bar for your leaders; don’t pull punches when it comes to the leaders you are looking for in the future (make it aspirational and future focused).</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Make sure that you have leaders who can not only lead the business (e.g., make the right calls and balance long term with the short term), but also inspire their people and create the right focus. Above all, in transformation, find leaders who are resilient and can thrive under pressure.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Focus on leaders’ readiness to scale, not just their potential.</li>
</ol>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the biggest challenges facing organizations is developing a robust pipeline of scalable leaders. RHR’s Executive Bench® suite of services is designed to build the next generation of enterprise leaders. As part of this suite of services, RHR first launched Readiness for Scale℠, an in-depth assessment that pinpoints strengths to leverage and gaps to close in preparation for executive leadership. RHR is now introducing Scaling for Growth℠, a best-in-class executive development program that closes gaps in scalability and accelerates readiness for enterprise leadership. Together, the Readiness for Scale and Scaling for Growth programs provide companies with a comprehensive solution for building a strong pipeline of enterprise leaders.

The Scaling for Growth program differs from other development programs in a number of ways:
<h3>Focus on building scalability</h3>
RHR's Scaling for Growth is more targeted than most development programs in its focus on building scalability. Companies often customize development programs based on competency models and/or current business challenges. While programs of this type can add value, Scaling for Growth focuses on the capabilities most essential to developing scalable leaders. These capabilities remain constant regardless of industry, competency model, or the particular challenges an organization currently faces.
<h3>Tight link between assessment and development</h3>
Readiness for Scale and Scaling for Growth are programs built around the same model of scalability. Through the Readiness for Scale assessment, participants obtain deep insights regarding which areas to target in the interest of promoting scalability. With Scaling for Growth, they then have the opportunity to close gaps in scalability.
<h3>Strong emphasis on behavior change</h3>
The Scaling for Growth program places a primary emphasis on behavior change. Instead of overwhelming people with content, they receive repeated opportunities to practice new behaviors and build new habits, all in the interest of strengthening scalability. During the program, participants make 21-day behavioral commitments, self-reporting on their progress via weekly surveys. Participants also learn how to continue making behavioral shifts beyond the end of the formal program. Over time, behavioral changes extend the boundaries within which leaders can operate effectively, ultimately allowing them to drive impact in roles of increased scope and complexity.
<h3>A compressed action learning project</h3>
Often used in development programs, action learning projects give participants an opportunity to develop new leadership skills by tackling an existing business challenge. Despite their many benefits, action learning projects frequently occupy a disproportionately large amount of participants’ time and attention, providing an opportunity to “dive deep” into one area but inadvertently distracting them from others. The Scaling for Growth program employs a compressed action learning project spanning one-and-a-half days, during which an innovative idea is generated and then proposed to a panel of internal executives for consideration. The project encourages participants to adopt a more future-oriented outlook they can apply with their own teams.
<h3>Partnership with the Johnson &amp; Johnson Human Performance Institute®</h3>
To excel in enterprise-level roles, leaders must cultivate the physical, mental, and emotional resilience needed to thrive in demanding and rapidly shifting environments. Through a partnership with the Johnson &amp; Johnson Human Performance Institute, leaders in RHR's Scaling for Growth program learn to optimize their energy level and unleash their best performance in high-stakes situations.
<h3>Timing of development plan</h3>
Typically, development plans are crafted at the front end of a program. Using Scaling for Growth, the development plan is built at the conclusion of the program, after participants have acquired and consolidated insights regarding gaps in scalability. By this point, participants also have had ample exposure to—and are thus well-equipped to reapply—the model for creating sustainable behavior change.
<h3>Measurement to demonstrate ROI</h3>
Measurement is a cornerstone of the Scaling for Growth program. Before entering the program, participants receive benchmarked ratings of their capabilities as part of the Readiness for Scale assessment. During the program, participants complete a brief, weekly survey evaluating progress against behavioral commitments. At the 12-month mark, a 360-degree assessment measures changes in scalability, thus quantifying the program’s ROI.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve been involved in several situations lately where a sudden CEO departure has left a gaping hole. At times, it is due to a performance or results issue. But there are also a number of times where unanticipated health or life circumstances and issues have caused abrupt changes. There is no name taped to the bottom of a drawer that suggests who the outgoing CEO thinks is ready, and the board has not fully addressed the issue of succession planning. The obvious solution is for the board and leadership to always have an ongoing dialogue about who is being developed for the top job. My colleague, Paul Winum, provides a terrific <a href="http://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/how-develop-your-ceo-succession-candidates">roadmap in a blog post he wrote about companies that have several years to get internal candidates ready.</a>

When the need for someone to lead is acute, boards will often turn to one of the directors to run the company in the short term. Meanwhile, boards start to look both inside and outside the company for someone to take over permanently. They often ask whether there is a difference between bringing in the new CEO from inside or outside the company. <b>There is actually fairly compelling data that CEOs promoted from within have an advantage at being successful in the role</b>. The results are meaningful in tenure, senior team retention, and success. Research and hard data provide the following conclusion:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Internal hires last longer.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Internal hires boost shareholder returns more: 4.6% for internals versus .1% for external hires.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">External hires do more effective cost-cutting in troubled companies in the early years but do not successfully maintain forward momentum post belt tightening.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">In the short term, inside and outside CEOs have the same degree of success in driving change when measured by return on assets in the first three years. Over the long term, however, insiders have a more positive impact by driving modest levels of change. Outsiders have a heightened disruptive effect when driving major changes, particularly when a company is not in dire straits.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Companies hiring outside candidates tend to have greater turnover at the executive level in the early stages, slowing both momentum and active initiatives.</li>
</ul>
There is further risk of error in that internal candidates with well-known strengths and weaknesses do not look as exciting as outsiders (shiny, bright-object scenario).

There are clearly situations where an outside hire is essential. The above presumes that internally-groomed successors and external candidates are of equal competence. Any internal successor must still prove themselves to the board and gain the executive team’s confidence. The board’s responsibility is to get a full measure of each candidate’s capabilities whether they come from inside or outside. RHR often works in concert with search firms when they are proposing outside candidates. The best strategy is to continually engage in objectively assessing, developing, and nurturing quality internal people while still keeping an eye out for prospects who could contribute to strong results for the organization over the long term. The brief article I referenced above by Paul Winum should be a meaningful starting point in engaging the board on what the company needs in the future and how to design an assessment and development program that will ensure organizational success.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As a leader, it is particularly painful when top talent chooses to leave the company. The loss of these employees can be perceived as a misplaced investment of your time and energy. If you are not careful, your frustration and competitive fire can result in broken relationships. Companies will spend money and effort in exit interviews and counteroffers, only to find that it is too late to reengage. Often, individuals will point to compensation as a reason for leaving, but money is usually just a smokescreen for the real reason.
<h3>So why do good people leave? Here are some possible reasons:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>The boss</b>—The manager is a powerful force in retaining key talent. If the employee does not perceive that their leader is committed to their ongoing success, they will quickly look for greener pastures.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Lack of development</b>—The relationship between loyalty and security in corporate life is broken. The only real security that employees have is knowing that they have skills to compete in the job market. Employers who fail to develop their talent can expect them to leave as soon as a better learning opportunity comes along.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Sense of self-efficacy</b>—Top performers need to know that their efforts make a difference in the businesses that they work in. If there is a disconnect between what they do and business results, it leads to disengagement. In these times of full employment, it is not difficult for workers to find better opportunities elsewhere.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Peer relationships</b>—Work is fundamental to formation of adult identity. People spend a lot of time at work, and the relationships that they develop with their coworkers help give their life meaning. As companies sever those relationships through remote worksites and hoteling strategies to save money, they risk weakening the interpersonal bonds that keep people in place.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Lack of a career path</b>—Most people will look for opportunities to move up in the corporate food chain. To the extent that their path is unclear or nonexistent, top talent will quickly look to move to a new employer that offers them opportunity to grow and improve their status. This factor can be particularly important in retaining key individual contributors who choose not to enter management tracks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How to retain key staff:</h3>
<b>To hang onto your top performers, the manager needs to show them how important they are to the company’s success.</b> Providing a line of sight between individual achievement and company results is a powerful way to remind employees of their worth. For example, working in accounts receivable can be a daunting task, but having an effective collections department is fundamental to company success. If that job is not performed well, it will be difficult to balance the budget. Successful completion of these tasks is critical to overall company growth. Reminding people just how important they are is a small but essential part of leadership.

<b>Managers also need to use praise liberally to reinforce employee self-worth.</b> Psychological research shows that positive reinforcement is a much more powerful determinant of behavior than punishment is. Catching your people doing something right and commenting on it in a public forum will encourage long-term retention of key talent. Use criticism sparingly and always in a private setting.

<b>Employees need continual reminders of how the work environment enables their achievement of their personal life goals.</b> Toward that end, development and coaching of staff needs to be an ongoing process, not an annual event. To start, managers should talk with their employees to understand what motivates them. Once the manager knows what is important to their direct reports, they can arrange for support vehicles to enable employee success. That may involve removing organizational obstacles, providing resources, and arranging for on-the-job work experiences that enable individual growth and development.

<b>Creating a winning culture is another way that management can encourage retention.</b> To do so requires not just the right strategy, but alignment around a fundamental set of values of how to work together. Paying attention not just to business results but also the way that the goals are achieved can send a powerful message that will engage employees’ hearts and minds.

Even if managers do all of these suggested activities, people will still leave companies. Some level of employee turnover is not only inevitable, but should be encouraged, as it will ensure a fresh supply of new ideas in your organization. The key to employee retention is to provide the best learning and development environment that you can muster, and recognize that the talent that you develop is truly your legacy.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Corporate environments are often defined by an inherently competitive environment where clarity on how to be successful becomes increasingly more difficult and information becomes increasingly scarce as employees climb to higher levels. Leaders find themselves lacking critical conversations and are left with unanswered questions about how to navigate their careers. Even in the most rich and open-feedback cultures, employees often live in ambiguity. It is evident that the best feedback mechanisms are unable to consistently and honestly answer the questions that cross an executive’s mind—and executives are left with their own personal assumptions about what success looks like. In the best environments, leaders struggle to feel assured that the answers they are given are actionable or that they clearly understand expectations. In the most feedback-scarce environments, clarity is often provided to only a select set of individuals who may feel a deep sense of belonging while their peers feel excluded. Many leaders struggling with a high degree of uncertainty are left wondering about their future, their path to success, and whether they will be able to accomplish their personal goals within the organization. The impact of this uncertainty begins to translate to fear—the fear of failure or the fear that whatever they do will not be enough to achieve their goals.

There is a great deal of research on fear and its impact on physical, mental, and emotional well-being, but I prefer to keep things relatively simple to make the point. In its most basic form, fear drives either a fight, flight, or stop response in all of us—none of which are productive to leadership growth or organizational agility.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Fight: On the positive side, this appears as drive, ambition, or a strong focus on execution. More often, it shows up as overly self-interested, competitive, an aggressive pursuit of one’s goals, or an overall scarcity mentality.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Flight: On the positive side, this appears as independence or a strong external perspective. More often, leaders appear disengaged, uncommitted, and uninterested in enterprise roles or contributions.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Stop (deer in the headlights): Leaders frozen by fear and uncertainty are the least productive. Often struggling to make sense of their current situation, they reach for any available data, create inaccurate stories, and fail to act in ways that allow them to demonstrate their true potential.</li>
</ul>
I would ask us to consider the impact of this uncertainty on marginalized executives—leaders who fall out of the norm within their organizational or predominate culture. For example, these individuals may have a different background, race, sexual orientation, or culture, often growing up in a unique socioeconomic environment or in a different country. Imagine feeling as if you are already excluded, struggling both to understand how to adapt to the predominant culture and to manage through ambiguity and uncertainty. The result is an intensification of fear and its impact on individual performance.
<h2>What Can We Do?</h2>
The most critical and important set of actions does not focus on providing additional feedback mechanisms or online career ladders or checklists for how to navigate the organization. I am not advocating for the removal of these processes or tools; they are an essential part of corporate hygiene and provide the foundation leaders need.

Instead, I will go in a different and likely unexpected direction. Fear and uncertainty are base emotions that affect us on the most human level. As a result, our actions must be more human. Executives must build a deeper foundation of trust with the talent in their business. Leaders must feel both seen and understood. Maximizing the strengths in teams means that we connect to the potential and capabilities in all employees. Executives have taken the time to understand what motivates, drives, and shapes their leaders. Now they must build connections that allow for conversations to focus on both the intention <i>and</i> impact of behavior and performance, not just the impact. Ultimately, this will create an environment where diversity is additive and the talent feels free to be authentic and look for opportunities to add value.

&nbsp;

A few tips:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Be disciplined and structured about the frequency of your meetings. Move away from the formal HR checkpoints as the only check-ins on how someone feels about their career.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Ask meaningful questions about who individuals are, what inspires them, and what success would enable them to accomplish in their lives.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Conduct sessions with the team to identify the myths within the culture on talent decisions.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Be courageous enough to ask individuals how they feel or what their biggest source of stress is.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Be willing to share stories about who you are, and create space for others to talk about the meaningful events that have shaped their lives.</li>
</ul>
Most importantly, ask for help. Building trust both one-on-one and across the team is an executive muscle that must be exercised. Consider measuring trust across the organization and bringing in an expert to help develop an open and inclusive environment.

Leaders have a remarkable opportunity to create a sense of hope, optimism, and followership with their teams, mitigating fear and building agile, productive, and inclusive environments.]]></content:encoded>

		<title><![CDATA[New Thinking on Board Evaluations: Give Directors Feed-Forward]]></title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since 2009, the New York Stock Exchange has required the boards of listed companies to conduct annual board performance evaluations. The corporate governance codes in Europe all stipulate that annual board evaluations be conducted. And in the UK, the prescription is to use an outside facilitator for that process at least every third year.

In the first few years of the NYSE requirement, many boards responded to the mandate with a rather cursory, “check the box” process that was motivated more by the compliance imperative than the desire to improve the board’s effectiveness. Often, it involved simply distributing a brief survey to all board members. The results were tabulated, and the box was checked.

Best practices in governance today require a much more rigorous approach. In addition to a thorough evaluation of full board and committee effectiveness, individual director feedback should be a component of a robust board assessment. However, <a href="https://www.directorsandboards.com/news/are-boards-effective-giving-feedback-each-other">studies</a> indicate that only slightly more than half of boards actually delivered peer feedback, and about one-third of the boards that did report that those reviews were ineffective.

One of the chief reasons many boards choose to forego individual director evaluations is that gathering and delivering feedback about director and board performance is a very sensitive process. Poorly done, it can damage the important collegial culture inside the boardroom and inject a tone of caution and distrust into directors’ relationships with each other.

However, most directors who serve on boards are highly responsible, conscientious business leaders who genuinely want to contribute value and would want to know if they are not performing as expected. In fact, 90% of the 625 directors who responded to a <a href="https://boardmember.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Great-Boards-2016.pdf">joint RHR International/NYSE Governance Services survey</a> indicated that they would like feedback about their performance as a director. So, the question is how can important information be delivered to directors in a constructive manner?

One answer is <i>feed-forward</i>, <i>not feedback</i>. This distinction is more than semantic. Considering that the overarching intention of board and director evaluations is to continually enhance contributions <i>in the future</i>, a focus on what can be done differently going forward to maximize value is much more critical than past performance. While referencing former behavior may be helpful to highlight themes, the majority of boards and directors will benefit most from candid suggestions about how they can improve their contributions in the future. Drawing upon RHR’s decades of experience in this realm, here are a few recommendations for providing feed-forward.

<b>Be clear and explicit about the expected value proposition for the board and each director.</b> Our experience tells us that directors come into their board service with a variety of implicit assumptions about how they think they should contribute. Some directors, motivated by the desire to be helpful, can cross the line from governance oversight into management. Others, wanting to provide a rigorous check on management, can adopt an adversarial posture. The board chair and/or lead director need to be explicit about the expected value proposition of the full board and of each director in the initial selection and onboarding process as well as in director evaluations.

<b>Set up the board and director evaluations with a future orientation. </b>Whether the evaluations are conducted internally or via an outside facilitator, the board survey and interviews with directors (the best-practice combination) should focus on how the board, committees, and individual directors can function even more effectively in the future rather than how they have functioned in the past. This is especially important in light of the fact that the aforementioned RHR/NYSE study indicated that organizations need different things from their boards and directors as the operating landscape and company strategy evolve. Evaluations should focus on what the governance needs of the organization will be in the coming year(s) and how directors can contribute in the future context. Also, keep in mind that the best input is actionable, and any changing behavioral expectations should be clearly defined.

<b>Supplement the required annual evaluation with ongoing input from the board chair or lead director. </b>An annual evaluation is an effective way for a board to gauge how it is functioning and how it can improve its effectiveness going forward. In addition, regular and immediate input provides the best opportunity for behavior reinforcement or modification. Board chairs and lead directors should be proactive in giving feedback and suggestions for improvement to each director in an ongoing fashion throughout the year. This is a great way to follow up on recommendations from the annual evaluation process and, in many cases, may involve simply calling out what a director is doing well that adds value. In other cases, individual directors may benefit from timely course corrections about how they conduct themselves and how they can contribute more effectively in the future. This aspect of the role of chair and lead director is critically important and takes a high level of interpersonal skill.

Taken together, these three suggestions can lead to an effective feed-forward approach to board and director evaluations that will result in raising the contributions of boards to the organizations they govern.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Executives tend to have a few key attributes they look for in the next generation of leaders that signal a promise of greater things to come. The executives then become energetic advocates for individuals demonstrating these aspects; they write glowing performance reviews and do what they can to ensure these early stars are in the forefront when promotion decisions are made. Usually, these prized attributes represent a subset of the competencies identified in their organizations’ talent models and constitute a trusted shortcut for busy, experienced executives.

However, there is a cumulative cost for these seemingly obvious choices, as they tend to bestow unearned halos on some and cast shadows on others, causing organizations to miss critical flaws in their targeted talent and to overlook the capabilities of others hidden in plain view.

For the targeted talent, the halo effect created means their advocates assume they possess additional skills and competencies (which may not be true) without actually vetting (or even recognizing) the assumptions. Rapidly promoting these individuals without sufficient due diligence causes organizations to miss the opportunity to correct problem areas early while the employees are still amenable to change (or before decision makers realize that the individual cannot flex). Unfortunately, rapid promotions can reinforce behaviors that will not sustain success at higher levels. Eventually capability gaps can emerge in these “stars” that either cause them to stall or to derail, sometimes spectacularly.

On the flip side, individuals who do not exhibit the prized behaviors to the same extent do not benefit from vocal advocates and may be pushed to the shadows; they are assumed to be lacking in other fundamental skills (again without further verification). There is not sufficient focus and energy in the talent discussion to bring to light their actual contributions and capabilities or to recognize that they are ready for the next challenge. Thus, they become hidden talent, passed over for positions for which they are more qualified and putting brakes on their careers that force them to eventually leave for organizations without such blinders.

For example, some leaders prize an individual who stands out and takes charge. Those individuals who gravitate to the spotlight, manage up well, and ensure acknowledgement for their achievements are thus more likely to be noticed. What may be less clear is how these same individuals influence their peers or how much scorched earth was created to realize those achievements. At the same time, an unintended shadow may also be cast on those who quietly create alignment and generate momentum across the organization as they may also more readily share credit and do not focus on the limelight. Yet, it is not by accident that they are consistently on the teams that make a difference for the organization. The evidence is there, but you must look for it.
<h2>What to do:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Know which attributes are the shiny objects that may cause you to take shortcuts in your view of talent. For example, beware the assumption that those who are good at managing up are also adept at creating followership; likewise, notice who is creating followership and results without much fanfare.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Watch out for buzzwords or adjectives that either push someone into the shadows or create halos. There are substantial diversity implications as the short-cut models may not be valid against a more heterogeneous group.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Ensure that talent discussions are based on data. Leverage development assessments to ensure a well-rounded view of the individual that does not rely on assumptions. It is remarkable how much data an organization has regarding its talent that is not included when key decisions are actually made.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Identify critical roles in the organization that provide core experiences for developing the talent pipeline and ensure that the scan for internal candidates is broad and the decision process is objective and disciplined. These roles create important paths for developing the future leadership pipeline and should not be clogged by the result of a limited view of organizational resources.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">If necessary, bring in an external party who will question assumptions and ensure a robust discussion.</li>
</ul>
It is natural for executives to leverage their own experience in identifying and cultivating talent, and doing so will tend to veer toward quickly creating a type of focus. However, just as stretching remains critical to any physical regimen, an organization must stretch its ability to identify, vet, and grow a wide range of individuals to ensure the overall viability of the talent pipeline and the ongoing success of the next generation of senior executives.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently had a discussion on creating organizational impact with a C-level executive of a large corporation. We chatted about how important and yet difficult it was for him to find time to connect to the many people in his national organization.

While challenging, it is still possible to build structures that can accelerate a leader’s ability to create connections through layers. This will increase the likelihood that personnel—from the top through the shop floor—understand and are aligned around strategy. I want to offer a couple of ideas on how to create useful tools that are quite simple and yet have a powerful impact, in part because they are deliberate and still authentic. They might be called “leadership hacks” in today’s vernacular.
<h2>Deepening Awareness of a Company Strategy</h2>
Often members of the senior team have a sound awareness of the strategy. They should; because they created it! Yet more than one layer down, people may not. What to do? Well, here’s what <i>not</i> to do. . . . Do <i>not</i> hold a town hall and present a slide show! Instead, next time you are in the cafeteria at work, try this. Tell the person behind you that you will buy their lunch if they can list the four pillars of the current strategy (or whatever is a key message that must get through the noise). If they know what it is, they get a free lunch, and everyone that person sees will know the strategy before tomorrow’s lunch. If the person does not know it, they will before tomorrow in the hopes of another chance. This is what I call a “twofer.” Something like this goes viral fast and you get two benefits for the price of one lunch. Furthermore, the individual may get some bragging rights.
<h2>Building Better Bonds Through Layers</h2>
From time to time, skip-level leaders walk through their departments with the manager for meet and greets with staff. Sometimes employees are nervous and do not know what to say except “hello” or respond to questions. Instead, tell the department leader to provide you with a list of two to four people to speak with, their personal situation (vacation, baby, kids, etc.), and/or their professional progress (such as their work on an important assignment, recent sales win, a certification, success on a project). When the leader stops and offers praise, congratulations, or asks questions about the event, it is meaningful to each individual. It shows concern and interest. Those individuals also tell their friends and it has positive ripples as it goes viral. The interest cannot be feigned, of course. Actually, this one is more than a twofer, because it requires the manager/director to know things about their employees. It demands engagement from them too!.

These small “hacks” reflect what my colleagues always say, “a little structure goes a long way.” Each is deliberate and yet provides an opportunity to connect and build relationships between levels. If you are a manager, director, or C-level individual, try it out. If you are a frontline employee, go guerilla and slip a copy of this blog under the door of someone a couple of layers above you. I’d be curious to see if they read it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We’re at one of those moments in the gaming industry where leaders and insiders are experiencing as much excitement as their consumers.

Casinos now exist, or will soon pop up, in the majority of states. Las Vegas is no longer a destination with a peculiar product, but rather a trendsetter for far-flung regional markets. Projected steady U.S. growth continues despite a hodgepodge of local regulations and turbulent cycles of expansion and consolidation. At the same time, the nascent rapid growth of Asian and European markets is going to provide headlines for expansion and innovation through the next decade. Last but not least, new legal gaming opportunities for consumers are coming (or coming back). The recent SCOTUS ruling in <i>Murphy v. NCAA</i> paves the way for widespread sports betting. With online daily fantasy sports (DFS) sites as well as legitimate sportsbooks jockeying for a stake in sports wagering, it’s only a matter of time before internet gaming is revisited as a once and future frontier for the industry.

All of these expansions and innovations require savvy leadership to shepherd growth, create new products, and protect the integrity of the games and their players. In short, talented leadership is going to be at a premium in the gaming industry. Of course, economic growth and ever-decreasing unemployment numbers are rising tides that lift demand for talented leaders in most industries. However, there are specific trends in gaming that require special attention as the next generation of leaders are recruited and developed.
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Managing the tension inherent in consolidation and geographical expansion.</b> MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment Corporation alone account for about a quarter of U.S. gaming revenue, and they reach domestically from Vegas to the Atlantic. Among next-tier companies, there is significant M&amp;A activity (e.g., Penn National buying Pinnacle, which itself absorbed Ameristar in the recent past). These transactions can create a great deal of turbulence, but they also provide the opportunity to revisit guiding principles and strategies and shape corporate culture. While these defining characteristics of a company are overseen by the C-suite and board, it’s the next levels of senior leadership who make sure they are spread throughout the company. It is important to place in these positions (usually general managers of properties or functional experts) people who can pivot between “managing up and down.” They should be able to communicate the “corporate message” to the rank and file while advocating to and informing the chief officers. Beyond business savvy and knowledge, they must show interpersonal flexibility and courage to sometimes toe the corporate line and lead local experimentation.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>"Building” versus “buying” next-generation leaders is becoming more prevalent.</b> As more people live within commuting distance of some kind of casino or racino, gaming companies need to be prepared to compete for talent in all markets. Whereas twenty years ago, middle management and experts in smaller domestic markets may have cut their teeth in Atlantic City or Las Vegas, they are now as likely to have been “bought” from another field altogether. On the other hand, companies have to be prepared to invest in and “build” high-potential junior leaders. They can grow engagement and loyalty by offering these people opportunities to grow their responsibilities and have mobility to larger markets and corporate leadership.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Developing leaders who can work cross-culturally has never been so important.</b> While Las Vegas has long been an international destination, now any casino near a multinational company is a prime option for business entertainment. Additionally, gaming companies have to keep in mind that land-based casinos in the U.S. are a mature industry, and the most explosive growth will come from having a presence in Macau, Singapore, and nascent Eastern/Central European markets. Leaders who can translate their knowledge and “people skills” across language and culture boundaries will have many options for upward (and outward) mobility.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Untapped online potential is the biggest opportunity for the gaming industry.</b> “Black Friday” largely shut down U.S. consumers’ options for online wagering, leading to large segments playing (with various degrees of legality) through offshore casinos. However, there are sundry exceptions to a total online ban (e.g., pari-mutuel wagering, games of skill, and extensions of land-based casinos). This suggests that more opportunities will arise as demand (and potential for government revenue) grows. Companies should be investing now in people who have the capabilities to not just develop these potential verticals, but to work through and influence the regulatory morass that surrounds them.</li>
</ol>
Investing the time and headspace into a talent strategy that addresses these unique issues should not just be the job of human resources. Top-level executives and market general managers should make finding, keeping, and growing their best people a top priority. Developing the next generation of leaders can be a big house edge for years to come.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/great-remote-leadership-part-1-essential-behaviors">previous post</a> of this two-part series, we looked at five essential behaviors demonstrated by great remote leaders. These were: clarify aligned goals, promote inclusivity, share leadership, build trust via competence, and create connections. The remaining four factors center around decisions leaders make to set the stage for successful remote teams. These decisions enable leaders to more clearly exhibit the behaviors described in part 1 that inspire followership, stimulate thinking, and build relationships—even among widely dispersed, remote teams.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Communication frequency.</b> Leaders consistently highlighted the communications they have with their direct reports, skip-level team members, peers, partners, and project teams. The forums and times of communication are well planned and consistent, so leaders and team members are never surprised and always prepared. One manager asserted that remote leadership all comes down to communication. Another said that being available for ad hoc team communications is paramount. The impact of these actions was evident in the engagement survey results: remotely managed team members reported feeling more informed about decisions and more satisfied with communications than team members in the rest of the organization. It’s important to note that many of these connections are informal, and leaders highlighted the importance of making personal connections with team members beyond their direct reports in all locations. They made a point to maximize face-to-face time spent onsite at remote locations by scheduling informal Q&amp;A sessions, lunches, or dinners with small groups of team members.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Organization of work.</b> Although various leaders described different strategies and preferences, each explicitly mentioned that the location of team members was considered before structuring and assigning work. For example, some leaders advocated a “follow the sun” (FTS; always on, with work getting passed from location to location as they get up in the morning) model because their work is operational in nature and requires continuous availability. Other leaders described how they used FTS to accelerate project completion by having distributed team members continuously working on development tasks around the clock. Yet other leaders cited inefficiencies and high process loss when implementing FTS with complex design and development projects and preferred to use a location-based approach to project assignment, matching specific centers of expertise around the world. While these approaches differ widely, the common theme is careful consideration of how to organize work to maximize effectiveness and efficiency. By carefully considering the distribution of work, they are able to capitalize on efficiencies (avoiding employee disengagement by clustering nonstrategic work at one location) and minimize potential challenges to success (such as delays due to miscommunication).</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Location strategy.</b> Leaders consistently mentioned the need to have a “critical mass” of team members at each location. While exceptions were commonly made for more experienced employees, there was a clear bias to co-locate team members (especially new hires) with similar skill sets to allow for more collaboration. Some leaders also mentioned a potential need to rationalize locations to move toward fewer, larger hubs. Another strategy frequently mentioned was co-locating support functions with their internal clients. They felt that larger locations were not only easier to manage but also provided greater career opportunities for employees. One leader stated, “Having an engineer alone doesn’t allow him to collaborate, learn, etc. . . .”</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Communication modality.</b> Most of the leaders interviewed described a rigorous travel schedule to allow periodic face-to-face interactions with remote teams. They clearly described the need to build relationships through in-person visits during the initial stages and to maintain those relationships with periodic (if less frequent) in-person visits. Leaders also expressed a preference to bring teams together for in-person meetings as much as feasible to foster better communications and relationship building. On an ongoing basis, leaders expressed a preference for high-fidelity (but not necessarily high-tech) communication modes. While face-to-face and video conferencing are their preferred communication modalities, leaders talked about the importance of thoughtfully selecting the right communication modes for the message and coaching team members to do likewise. One leader shared, “We are trying to train team members to think about the right mode of communication. When you see a long email chain, just pick up the phone.”</li>
</ul>
Overall, many of the factors covered here aren’t unique to great remote leadership and are just good leadership practices. As noted by researchers and by our leaders, remote leadership requires adaptation, not radical changes. One leader stated, “We need good leadership in general.” Research suggests that most leaders choose more transactional, task-oriented leadership behaviors in remote teams at the expense of transformational behaviors (i.e., intellectual stimulation, inspirational motivation, and relationship orientation). This is partly because it is much more difficult to display transformational behaviors in the context of remote teams. The leaders we interviewed consistently emphasized their focus on exactly these behaviors with their remote teams. They acknowledged the difficulty but also clearly articulated the benefits and results for the organization and individual team members. To the extent that these leaders were able to adapt their leadership styles for remote leadership, others can do the same. By emphasizing transformational leadership, in general, and these nine factors, in particular, other leaders can practice great remote leadership.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Leading geographically dispersed teams is difficult. Time and again, research and practice have demonstrated the challenges of overcoming physical distance, different time zones, and cultural disparities to engage teams and lead them to accomplish shared objectives. However, we recently worked with a large, high-tech company experiencing unique success engaging, motivating, and managing remote teams.

We studied this organization’s employee-engagement data and conducted interviews with leaders who were particularly adept at remote leadership. We also reviewed findings from the academic literature to better understand the mechanisms behind their ability to be great remote leaders.

Overall, there were nine key practices that supported great remote leadership. In part 1, we’ll cover the five behaviors demonstrated by great remote leaders, and in part 2, we’ll look at four important management decisions these leaders make to enable these behaviors to have the most impact.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Clarify aligned goals.</b> Every leader interviewed emphasized the need to ensure team members understood how their work connected to the broader team and to the company’s strategic vision (as described by the CEO). One leader shared, “It’s very easy for the remote team to be focused on their own success but not the overall objective of [the company]. . .you want them to have independent projects, but you also want them to see the connection to the overall objective for the group. . .” Other leaders suggested that the company can be a very “noisy” place and that part of their job was to help employees focus on the most important things—those closely tied to the strategy—and see the connectedness and value in their work.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Promote inclusivity.</b> All the leaders lead teams across multiple time zones, often with eight hours or more difference among team members. Each mentioned the need to ensure that team meeting times are rotated to share the burden of “off hour” meetings across the team. While scheduling meetings was the most frequently mentioned challenge, leaders also highlighted differences in holidays, cultural workstyles, and language barriers. Leaders outlined some of the challenges inherent in leading culturally diverse teams (e.g., East Asian, South Asian, North American, Scandinavian, East European) within the context of an American company. One leader explained the need to approach cultural differences as a learning opportunity rather than trying to impose American culture on every location.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Share leadership.</b> Research shows that remote leadership works better when leadership is shared with team members or informal leaders at the various locations. All leaders interviewed for this paper explicitly or implicitly cited their reliance on key team members at remote locations to coach and support other team members. Multiple leaders pointed out that local leaders don’t necessarily need to be hierarchical leaders (i.e., holding a manager title) and could be someone more experienced and with a broader network beyond the location. Furthermore, team members were empowered to freely share their perspectives and use their own judgment to get the job done.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Build trust via competence.</b> We know from research that building trust among geographically dispersed teams is difficult. When asked about building trust, leaders consistently said that trust at their company is based on demonstrated competence. One said, “Here. . .trust comes from proving it.” They said it was important for individuals and teams to build a reputation through their ability to solve problems and get results. Some leaders even mentioned intentionally not stepping in with the solution and instead choosing to involve a remote team to create opportunities for individuals to have more input and demonstrate competence in a public way. All these leaders prioritize celebrating team accomplishments and recognizing exceptional achievements across the team. Additionally, many make a point of identifying experts in different areas and giving individuals opportunities to demonstrate knowledge and expertise to others.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Create connections.</b> Most leaders referenced creating connection through a shared vision and better communications, but some leaders also highlighted a focus on building connections for remote teams. They explained that connections go in multiple directions: among remote teams, back to corporate, and with internal clients. Most leaders referenced informal interactions when asked about creating connectedness—bringing people together in face-to-face settings for lunches, dinners, and other team-building activities. One leader mentioned sending group-wide announcements to introduce new hires and to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries so team members who are not located together see one another’s names and have another reason to reach out. Creating cross-team mentor pairings is another strategy mentioned to facilitate building informal relationships among team members. Some leaders described specifically creating opportunities to connect team members by organizing project teams across remote locations who may not otherwise have the chance to work together. Regarding creating a connection back to corporate, one leader stated that “the leader is the ‘flag bearer’ for the company.” That is, the leader must syndicate the corporate culture out to each individual location and employee by sharing corporate updates and ensuring everyone understands and connects with the larger team.</li>
</ul>
In the next and final part of this series, we will address the remaining four factors highlighting the key decisions remote leaders have to make to facilitate great remote leadership.]]></content:encoded>

		<title><![CDATA[Client Perspective: President & CEO John Doyle of Marsh]]></title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Designed to help CEOs and senior executives grow in their leadership, this occasional series offers insights that are seldom seen in textbooks on leadership and strategic planning.  </i>

As president and CEO of Marsh, John Doyle oversees Marsh’s brokerage and specialties, underwriting, digital technology, and consulting practices worldwide. Marsh is a part of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies [NYSE:MMC]. John was named CEO of Marsh in July 2017, and he previously served as its president since February 2016. John also serves on MMC’s executive committee. He joined Marsh from AIG, where he held a number of executive positions in his 30-year career there. John is a graduate of the University at Buffalo, and he is on the board of the New York Police and Fire Widows’ and Children’s Benefit Fund, and a trustee of the Inner-City Scholarship Fund.

John talked candidly with RHR’s senior partner David Astorino about the leadership skills and business philosophy that have enabled him to build and lead companies both large and small.

<b>David:  What is your leadership philosophy? How do you instill confidence among your many different stakeholders—regulators, brokers, partners, and employees in the company, for starters?</b>

<b>John:  </b>It begins with authenticity. That to me is the most important characteristic for effective leaders. We do have to answer to numerous constituencies in our industry. These are highly educated people who can see right through you if you’re not authentic. Next is transparency, followed by being clear on what your priorities are and what you’re trying to accomplish with those various constituencies. I think there’s a lot to learn from all of those constituencies, so being a good listener is critical.

<b>David:  There’s a certain humility to you that allows you to get into the shoes of someone else. Would you put humility in that mix, too?</b>

<b>John:  </b>I suppose so. But I don’t necessarily come to the office thinking I need to be humble. I’m practical about the fact that we work in a very complex business. We’re serving different types of clients—from organizations and individuals, as well as big, medium, and small businesses. And we advise them on all different types of risks. And that’s just one dimension of our business.

I do think it’s important to be confident, decisive, and clear. When you think about it on the risk dimension, there are so many different risks that we try to help our clients navigate. It’s incredibly interesting. At Marsh, we talk about being there during moments that matter. I really like that because there’s a real purpose to what we do. Whether it’s at a time of investment to drive innovation or at a time of loss like the nor’easter storms that hit late this winter, we are there making a real difference.

<b>David:  You’ve been in many different business situations. Has your leadership philosophy changed with your circumstances or remained the same?</b>

<b>John:  </b>Authenticity, transparency, and listening have always been in the mix, no matter the circumstance. Leaders often don’t focus as much on communicating their priorities. One thing all leaders can do more is to lean in to make sure folks understand what the company is trying to accomplish. Because if you don’t, the results won’t be stable for long. Having only a few priorities and being very clear and consistent about communicating them is key.

<b>David:  Given RHR’s work, we have had a long-standing interest in scalable leadership—leaders who can adapt to the demands of increasing complexity, scale, and impact. This is something you’ve done very effectively: adapting to different levels of scale and complexity. How do you do this?</b>

<b>John:  </b>The more senior the role, people are going to hang onto every word you say. So focus is important. I know I’ve got to say the same thing every single time; otherwise, with a global and decentralized organization, people can end up working at cross purposes.

<b>David:  Tell us about how you developed into a leader. </b>

<b>John:  </b>I’ve always enjoyed the responsibilities of leadership. It didn’t just start when I joined the workforce. Whether it was in team sports or even in the neighborhood organizing kids to get together to play games, there was an element of leadership. Trying to get my four brothers to accomplish whatever it was—this was a challenge.

When I was a trainee at AIG 32 years ago, I found I was constantly in search of context. I was a player on an eight-person team at that time. I had a sense of how I was doing. What I wanted to know was, how’s the team doing? How is the division doing? How is the subsidiary performing? I think it’s really important for our colleagues to understand the context around decisions that we make. Why are colleagues, clients, and growth Marsh’s priorities? Why are we pursuing a certain path? Our colleagues who think that way are the leaders of the future.

<b>David:  Sometimes we have mentors or experiences that teach us about leadership. What stands out to you in retrospect?</b>

<b>John:  </b>I was very fortunate to enter the business world as a trainee in directors and officers liability insurance. And I say that because part of the underwriting process was quizzing executives about the challenges and opportunities in their businesses—how they were navigating them. This was an incredible opportunity to talk to the general counsel of a company or the CFO of a company and occasionally even the CEO. As part of that training, I became an observer of leaders—in our firm, outside our firm— when I read the news.

<b>David:  Did you have mentors who have shaped your leadership? </b>

<b>John:  </b>Two incredibly influential leaders that I worked for were Hank Greenberg and Bob Benmosche. They were powerful and forceful and had different approaches. Bob was more focused on the process and approach of how you got to an outcome and Hank was very entrepreneurial.

Both approaches are incredibly important in terms of leading a company and team. It was fascinating to see how each one of them led. I really tried to learn from these approaches and challenged myself to do it in my own way. Both of these mentors were CEOs of AIG at different times and under very different circumstances. But to work for two leaders who accomplished so much in our industry was pretty instrumental. I learned from other mentors along the way too.

<b>David:  Let’s talk about diversity—globally diverse teams, different generations, different ethnicities, different cultural backgrounds. Why is that important to you?</b>

<b>John:  </b>It is a team game, the insurance business. For us to effectively serve a client, we need colleagues with all different kinds of skills. We need deep risk experts. We need colleagues that can help clients manage the cost of risk or invest in capabilities that will mitigate risk over time. The wide range of skills that you need to effectively serve a client is one of the fun things about our business. We do so many different things and need to do them well. And so that takes all types of colleagues with different backgrounds and different educational experiences who think differently.

As a leader, one of the most important things is to understand what your own blind spots are. I’m not going to be that deep technical expert in various risk practices that we have here at Marsh. Coming up with that diverse thinking, those diverse backgrounds is really important. And creating the opportunity for people to have a voice and to make sure their voices are heard is also important because some might be very willing to offer their opinions and then others on the team who have really important things to contribute might not be that kind of leader. There’s no question we’re so much stronger as a group than we are as individuals.

One of the great things about working here is that many people have such powerful and different experiences. And our job is to serve our clients. We’re paid to have an opinion.

<b>David:  One of the dynamics that can lead to bad decision making in companies occurs because the higher up you go, the more power is embedded in roles. When someone becomes the CEO or the person in the highest-ranking job, suddenly even people who used to be very candid and forthcoming unconsciously hold back or massage the message…they don’t want to take risks anymore.</b>

<b>John:  </b>I think it’s really important to create a safe environment where people can speak their minds. Even at the executive committee level, I’m always asking my team for their views. I make it very clear to everyone that I want their input. We are very fortunate here. We have a highly engaged executive committee. But I hold a lot of skip-level conversations too. One of my favorite things to do when I travel is to meet with young professionals and emerging top talent in cities all around the world. What I enjoy about those conversations is I don’t have to encourage them to speak. I also try to see a client every single day to hear directly from them how we’re doing.

<i>We’d like to thank John for taking the time to sit with us and talk in such depth.</i>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As I write this from my home in Toronto, we are having a provincial election that will be unlike any other in Ontario’s history. And here are some thoughts about the election that will ring true once it is over.

As in many other jurisdictions around the world, the political center is eroding in Ontario, and voters are left with a stark choice. One party has campaigned on a platform that is staunchly pro-union with new spending on social programs, paid for by deficit spending combined with higher taxes on the wealthy and a higher corporate tax rate. The rival party has campaigned on a “respect for taxpayers” populist platform of smaller government with a promise of rooting out inefficiencies that are surely a code for a reduction in services.

What is clear is that Ontario will wake up to a very different reality after the election. The province will feel very different depending on the outcome of the election. I had the same feeling the day Justin Trudeau was elected. The country immediately felt different to me from the decade or so that Stephen Harper was in power. Yet it was still the same country with the same citizens as the day before, as Ontario will be after this election, no matter what the outcome.

But there will be a big difference, one way or another, and that difference is leadership. More specifically, the winner of the election will focus on a particular aspect of the province and its citizens. He or she will be a megaphone, if you will, for a particular set of values and beliefs. Both sides of the political spectrum are represented in the province in almost equal numbers, but the winner will give voice to the one side of that equation that will prevail for the next four years. The impact of leadership will be defining, and in some ways, out of proportion to the reality on the ground. Leadership is a very powerful tool in amplifying a particular set of values and beliefs.

I was thinking about this and how it relates to leadership in organizations. Why is one team collaborative and cohesive while another siloed and suspicious of one another’s motives? Why are organizational cultures so different from one another, yet they draw talent from similar pools and populations? Selection can help to explain some of this, but not all of it.

When leaders think about the kind of culture and dynamic they want to foster on their team or in their organization, they conceive of it as a change process. They focus on the gap between what is and what they want it to be, and then they put together a process to go from one state to the other. Instead, what if they used their megaphone to tell people where their vision of the team or organization—or their particular set of values and beliefs—are already present?

It seems to me that would be a more natural and constructive way to approach a change process. This would include tactics such as highlighting examples of the culture and values you want to promote. Perhaps more importantly, it would be a mindset shift for the leader to be a facilitator of the culture he or she wants to see emerge rather than trying to fight against the existing culture or trying to convince the team or organization of the validity of their particular perspective.

I think leaders would find that way of framing the issue not only more effective, but more enjoyable as well.

Now I’m off to vote for my choice of megaphone. Wish me luck.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Effective leadership often comes down to two critical tasks: making good decisions and engaging others to execute those decisions.

While such reductionism can sound simple (or even simplistic), those two tasks can be quite complex. Making good decisions at the upper level requires a deep understanding of how optimal decision making occurs, as well as the pitfalls that can accompany it. Having a poor process can significantly impact morale and performance. Our colleague, Steve Madenberg, recently wrote a humorous blog post highlighting <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/thought-bubbles-unproductive-senior-team-meetings">the downsides of unthoughtful decision making and “death by meetings” on senior teams.</a> While it’s easy to poke fun at Dilbert-like experiences that we have all participated in (and some of us even perpetuated!), there are direct correlations between poor senior team meeting management—of which loose and unintentional decision-making processes are a cornerstone—and morale of the senior-most leaders in the company. This all impacts company performance in real and tangible ways.

Research points to the importance of effective decision making at the top of an organization and its subsequent impact on performance. RHR’s Senior Team Effectiveness survey found a remarkably strong relationship between the top team’s decision-making processes and quality1 with company performance (employee engagement, overall organizational performance, new product development, profitability/ROA, quality of products or services, sales, and revenue growth). (See Table 1).

When attempting to understand how decision making works, straightforward models work best. Utilizing a framework popularized by Dan and Chip Heath in their recent book <a href="http://heathbrothers.com/books/decisive"><i>Decisive</i></a> and syncing that up with our findings, we can define what a leader can do to ensure optimal decisions get made. (See Table 2).
<ol>
 	<li>
<h3>Framing: Defining the Problem to Be Solved or Decision to Be Made</h3>
</li>
</ol>
Framing is the first step of effective decision making and often the most misunderstood. To accurately frame the problem or decision, a leader must iteratively zoom in and zoom out until a clear definition of the problem emerges. Too often CEOs commit “narrow framing” and reduce the whole range of possible behaviors to a single binary choice (e.g., “should we pursue strategy A versus B”) before the decision process has even begun. They focus on what’s obvious and visible versus what is possible, and they can also hesitate to use their teams to help them frame a decision since it can feel unproductive and like a loss of power.

In the earliest stages of decision making, it’s important to widen the options. “Going slow to go fast” is never more applicable than in this stage; it’s better to take the time to accurately define the scope of the problem than move too quickly and work the issue at the wrong level, making fast but suboptimal decisions. Individual conversations with trusted sources—especially the senior team—can bolster engagement of senior leaders, making them feel valued as advisors and more willing to improve the quality and ultimately execution of the decision.
<ol start="2">
 	<li>
<h3>Analyzing: Exploring and Analyzing Options</h3>
</li>
</ol>
In the analyzing phase, leaders are faced with three primary challenges: individual cognitive biases, poor data, and dysfunctional team dynamics related to power struggles and politics. Overconfidence and confirmation biases come into play especially when leaders and teams feel a sense of urgency. They stop reality testing and seeking out disconfirming data to their impulsive conclusions. This becomes exacerbated when senior team members are jockeying for power or want to be seen in a positive light with the leader. They cease to be the reality filter for the CEO, choosing instead to eagerly support their boss to win favor.

To ensure the analyzing phase is as robust as it can be, leaders need to first ensure they are getting “good enough” data: data that is high quality and supports various points of view being raised. Second, they need to pay attention to their emotional states during analysis and their desire to come to premature closure. Lastly, they need to attend to group dynamics. One antidote can be to create roles on the team or in an advisory circle that are empowered to challenge and highlight risks or alternative scenarios.
<ol start="3">
 	<li>
<h3>Choosing: Making a Call or Choice</h3>
</li>
</ol>
“Making a call” on a decision can be confounded by two primary reasons:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Lack of clarity about who owns the decision. Interestingly, RACI models (clarifying who is responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed) seem to stop working at the CEO and senior executive levels since most believe they are above such processes. However, without clear ownership, fuzzy accountability prevails, and decisions can linger without action.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Emotional churn. At times, the consequences of the decision are so large in magnitude that deciding a course of action becomes agonizing due to the potential implications of the decision.</li>
</ul>
To address the first point, if the CEO is not the accountable executive for a decision, clearly and unequivocally delegating that authority is critical. Too often senior team members are watching the unspoken cues from the boss about how she or he feels about a decision, and execution will be stalled if the CEO does not fully support the accountable executive’s authority. And to the second point, getting some distance from the decision—especially for the most impactful and weighty ones—can provide the needed perspective and courage to make the biggest calls.
<ol start="4">
 	<li>
<h3>Executing: Living with the Results of a Decision Made (Aligning, Communicating, and Learning)</h3>
</li>
</ol>
Excessive overconfidence in the ability to execute a decision, pseudo-alignment, poor communication, and lack of tracking and learning from the previous important decisions are the primary challenges of this phase. Excessive confidence is most evident in the planning cycle where senior teams often commit to unrealistic metrics and goals. However, equally corrupting is pseudo-alignment, where team members feign agreement with a decision but fail to communicate or enforce it since it may negatively impact their area of responsibility.  And given the pressures many companies feel to perform in an increasingly unpredictable and fast-changing macro environment, the concept of a learning organization has all but evaporated. There are few senior teams that actively track the execution of their decisions to see where they are succeeding and/or falling short, what they can do about that, and what they can learn.

Scenario planning is the best antidote to excessive confidence. Preparing to be wrong and having alternative paths to execute are key tools that foster agility. Having norms regarding alignment and communication can also help ensure decisions are executed. For example, “80% agreement, 100% alignment” is one such norm that CEOs can enforce with consequences for noncompliance. And keeping a placeholder at the end of each meeting for determining how a decision will be communicated is a simple yet frequently eliminated part of the decision-making process for senior teams. Lastly, establishing a norm around learning from our decisions and taking a cue from the military’s “after action review” is one way to ensure the team and organization are harvesting important lessons that will shape future decisions.

Decision making is the cornerstone of organizational life. While the process is simple to understand, it collides with such tangibles as organizational structure, meeting management, and role clarity as well as with the intangibles of leadership, power, and cognitive biases. While our data on senior teams and decision making demonstrates that mastering the process is worth the effort, it takes commitment from the top to make it a reality.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the United States, we are in the midst of championship softball at the collegiate and high-school levels. The teams still in the running face increasing competition and expectations with each win, and continuing to progress requires impeccable teamwork that maximizes each opportunity while minimizing risks. And, as my daughter reluctantly pointed out to me (as she does not like my metaphors and is chagrined to realize she is also drawn to them), it is a great metaphor for the increasing onslaught of challenges leadership teams are currently navigating in their businesses.

Rapidly changing business landscapes are creating pressure on companies striving to grow their top and bottom lines while reinventing or significantly evolving their businesses. For the leadership team of a company or major business unit, it seems that success (and perhaps survival) demands that they do it all. Continuing with our metaphor, it is not enough to make the out—they have to consistently go for the double play. This requires a disciplined pursuit of more nuanced opportunities for improvement.
<h2>Establish a tighter approach to strategy.</h2>
While virtually all companies and business units create a long-term plan, the quality varies in terms of how clearly defined, compelling, and feasible the strategy is and how well it creates focus, alignment, and energy among the leadership group. Now more than ever, companies need top-notch and experienced strategic capabilities to rely upon, and teams that have it readily acknowledge this as a core strength. At this level of play, being good in this area is not enough.
<h2>Don’t stop at the 50,000-foot level.</h2>
Ensure that the strategic discussion becomes sufficiently granular and realistic to drive tough choices that match actions and initiatives to available resources or highlight expertise that may be missing to evaluate potential options. Acquisitions require capital and the right talent to integrate and run well; major upgrades in technology can create distractions and risk while not necessarily following intended timetables; and increasing organic growth may require significant process changes to build and leverage the innovation pipeline.
<h2>Create, foster, and reward an enterprise mindset.</h2>
At this level of competition and disruption, the path to the win is at the overall team or company level. Investing sufficiently in the opportunities likely to yield the greatest impact requires reducing resources in other areas, limiting success for a single leader and his or her group. At times the optimal result for a given at bat is to advance the other runners, not necessarily for the batter to get on base. This requires a mature and flexible mindset on the part of team members and a compensation system that rewards versus punishes the desired behaviors.
<h2>Align stakeholders.</h2>
Threading the needle in terms of major upgrades in technology or other capabilities, potential acquisitions, efficiency plays, and tackling key customer contract negotiations while growing the business is a risky endeavor. Ensuring that the board is aligned (or the board and C-suite for teams of business units) regarding the intended path, inherent risks, and required investment will be important to avoid distractions and ensure that support is there when needed. This takes more time and attention than one might think. One might assume that a field that drains well, is safe for the players, and comes with umpires who know and enforce the rules of the game would be a given for any softball competition, but that is not always the case.
<h2>Calibrate and adjust.</h2>
Even if the strategic plan is well vetted and links to the short-term operational plan, the game is not likely to unfold as expected. Difficult choices will need to be made along the way to ensure the organization is stretched, but not to the breaking point. More and more, leadership teams are faced with three options when an organization is hitting a limit to its ability to deliver on all strategic fronts: 1) proactively decide what will be stopped, diminished, or delayed; 2) let the choices unfold organically within the organization regarding what is not done or not done well; or 3) increase resources (internal or external) to do all that was planned on the same timeline. Signs that difficult choices may not be happening sufficiently at the leadership level include significant execution issues related to the core business or acquisitions, anemic innovation, widespread or consistently heated conflicts lower in the organization, and loss of key talent.

These are challenging and exciting times for business and for competitive softball teams. Adjusting to the new level of play is hard, but teams on both fronts are demonstrating what is possible.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the past year, there have been scores of reported misconduct in companies across virtually every industry and sector. From Weinstein to Wynn, from Volkswagen to Wells, the behavior of executive leaders has resulted in the dismissal of executive leaders, thousands of lawsuits, and tens of millions of dollars in fines and lost business. As questions about the accountability of boards and CEOs for these actions have accumulated, directors and executive suite leaders have been wrestling with the question of how they can exercise their influence to promote, sustain, and monitor workplace cultures that maximize organization performance and adhere to core values. Here is some guidance about how to do that.
<h2>First, the culture of an organization starts at the top.</h2>
As conveyed by the old saying “Where the head goes, the body follows,” people in organizations pay very close attention to and often emulate the behavior of their leaders. Board members and executive leaders need to develop and deliver against a code of conduct to which they hold themselves accountable. As culture is often defined as “how we do things around here,” generating and communicating company values and the behaviors that reflect those values is an important step. Board members and CEOs need to take a long, objective look in the mirror and ask themselves how the decisions and actions they take are reinforcing and advancing the values of the company. For example, a <a href="https://www.nacdonline.org/files/2017%E2%80%932018%20NACD%20Public%20Company%20Governance%20Survey%20Executive%20Summary.pdf">2017-2018 NACD Public Company Governance Survey</a> indicated that 76% of the directors who responded said the boards they serve on have discussed whether existing compensation practices are driving the right behaviors. I’m sure the boards of Wells Fargo and Volkswagen have been discussing that question in the last year. Has your board?
<h2>Second, the values and resulting code of conduct that the board and CEO develop need to be broadly communicated and discussed throughout the organization.</h2>
This should happen as part of every employee’s orientation and onboarding process but should also be part of the agenda for management and staff meetings throughout the year. Managers need to be continually vigilant about the kind of culture that exists within the teams they lead. Every business is replete with situations that present ethical dilemmas where leaders and employees are faced with difficult choices about how to pursue desired objectives. Good leaders ask about these dilemmas and help their staff think through the best ways to navigate them. These discussions should be happening in the boardroom, in the C-suite, and at every level across the company.
<h2>Third, just having a code of conduct and communicating it is not sufficient.</h2>
There needs to be ways to verify and confirm that people are behaving in accordance with company values and ethics. Another adage comes to mind: “Managers get what they <i>inspect,</i> not what they <i>expect.</i>” Practical and effective ways boards and leaders can do this is through the use of organizational culture and feedback surveys as well as open channels of communication. Every organization should conduct an organizational culture and engagement survey at least every other year where employees are given a confidential opportunity to weigh in on their managers, senior leadership, and experience of working in the organization. Periodic use of 360-degree stakeholder feedback can also provide data about how employees are being led and treated. Whistleblower policies should be in place and communicated so that everyone knows there is a channel for reporting misconduct in a safe way. The same <a href="https://www.nacdonline.org/files/2017%E2%80%932018%20NACD%20Public%20Company%20Governance%20Survey%20Executive%20Summary.pdf">NACD Public Company Governance Survey</a> cited above showed that 72% of the directors who responded said their boards reviewed whistleblower helpline reports and 64% reviewed code of conduct and values violations. Also, the practice of skip-level communication and supervision whereby managers occasionally interact directly with employees two or more levels below them in the organizational hierarchy can provide direct information about what’s going on in the workplace and invite direct feedback about leaders beyond their self-reports. So board members should take the initiative to talk with the subordinates of the CEO, and CEOs should have direct access to the subordinates of their senior leadership teams and so on.
<h2>A fourth and very important set of actions for boards and CEOs who want to shape culture in their organizations is in their response to instances when the code of conduct and ethics has been violated.</h2>
There is no better teaching moment than when misconduct occurs to reiterate and reinforce company values. When people misbehave and there is no consequence, the implicit message is that the behavior is going to be tolerated. Conversely, when a company takes bold and public action to remove or discipline an executive, manager, or employee, it underscores that the company is serious about its values and code of conduct. A recent example of this is the decision by Starbucks to close all of its more than <a href="https://news.starbucks.com/press-releases/starbucks-to-close-stores-nationwide-for-racial-bias-education-may-29">8000 U.S. stores</a> for a day of racial bias education. That’s putting your money where your mouth is and sending an unequivocal message to not only its workforce but to its entire customer base. Similarly, boards and leadership teams should celebrate employees who embody and exhibit desired values through recognition programs.

While there will always be misconduct and bad behavior in the workplace until the time when we will all be replaced by robots and computers, boards and executive leaders who are serious about shaping organizational culture and who follow these suggestions will minimize misconduct and cultivate positive, healthy, and high-performance cultures. Who knows? They may even get onto a list of responsible companies who are members of a community that could be known as #ThemToo.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>This is the third of a four-part series examining patterns of gender bias affecting female executives, and how “bias interrupters” can be used to challenge them.</i>

“I don’t do meetings after 4:00 p.m. on Tuesdays,” my new boss told me. “That’s when I coach my son’s soccer team.” He was the CHRO of the Fortune 500 company I had just joined, and his words made a huge impression on me. I was at a life stage where everything seemed to happen at once; with the first big corporate job plus a toddler at home, I was trying to figure out how to make things work. By conveying an unapologetic focus on his family, my boss let me know that it was going to be okay. More than a decade later, I remain grateful for him role modeling the possibility—and the expectation—to be a high-level executive as well as an active, engaged parent.

In our day and age, most organizations recognize the need for employees to balance work and personal lives, and they offer some kind of flexible work arrangements to make this happen. These initiatives, however, are not always taken advantage of to the extent envisioned. The varying uptake can almost always be traced back to cultural factors, not uncommonly linked to gender bias affecting both men and women. This “<a href="https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/josi.12012">flexibility stigma</a>” becomes problematic as it creates the perception that people who take advantage of flexible work arrangements are less committed to work. While initiatives lay a foundation for an inclusive work environment, it is the day-to-day behaviors of people—especially of those at the top—that makes the culture follow suit. When senior executives are deliberate about the behaviors they showcase, they become powerful role models that can shift culture in ways few initiatives can. In the spirit of Mother’s (and Father’s!) Day, then, let’s look at how that can be done.

As a first step, it is helpful to know something about the pressures more junior employees experience when it comes to combining work and family life. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_C._Williams">Dr. Joan C. Williams</a>, whose research we are exploring in this series on gender bias, talks about especially female leaders sometimes feeling the need to engage in yet another difficult <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0891243210383142">balancing act</a>. This time, it is about avoiding being seen as a bad worker (by putting her kids first), or a bad mother (for seeming overcommitted to work). To manage perceptions, parents of both genders can feel forced to describe their kids’ soccer game as an “out-of-office meeting” in their automatic email replies or calendar entries, or to be overly explicit about “traveling for business” to avoid the assumption of being home with kids. Here, senior executives can make a huge impact by simply showing an interest in their reports' family lives, asking about their kids’ activities, encouraging them to take part in them, and being outspoken when they themselves leave the office to spend time with their families.

Especially for women, parenthood can lead to fewer opportunities for <a href="http://gender.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/motherhoodpenalty.pdf">promotion and career development</a>. Anyone who has been part of a talent review meeting has likely heard the “it is probably not a good time for her” comment at the suggestion of combining family life, including young children, with a challenging new assignment. Because of this assumption, female leaders who wish to continue pursuing their careers after having children benefit from being very explicit about their willingness to travel, relocate, etc. By the same token, if you are the manager of a person just coming back from parental leave, make a point of scheduling a meeting where the individual’s short and long-term career goals can be discussed, and offer plum assignments as you normally would.

As with all kinds of advocacy, senior executives have a unique role to play when it comes to managing the organizational narrative about their reports. With that in mind, make sure to openly challenge sentiments such as, “I worry about her kids”, “pregnancy brain”, or “part-time work” (for when an employee leaves work at the formal end of the work day).

A work environment where people can be committed parents as well as workers not only harnesses but leverages their ability to contribute. By understanding the realities of working parents, and by being willing to challenge convention and be a role model, senior executives can become the true agents of cultural and organizational change.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Designed to help CEOs and senior executives grow in their leadership, this occasional series offers insights on leadership seldom seen in textbooks. This is the first of a two-part interview. </i>

Ravi Saligram, CEO and director of the board of Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers, is a visionary leader with a proven track record of growing businesses, building brands, developing customer-centric teams, embracing digital, focusing on cash flow, and driving shareholder value. Throughout his career he has inspired employees to challenge the status quo, created cultures driven toward innovation, and built industry-leading, diverse, and inclusive leadership teams.

Ravi was appointed CEO of Ritchie Bros. in 2014 and since then has been transforming the company by evolving the world’s largest onsite heavy-equipment auctioneer into a relationship-based, technology-enabled, and data-driven multichannel asset management and disposition platform. In 2017 Ravi led the acquisition of online leader IronPlanet, making Ritchie Bros. one of the top 50 B2B e-commerce players in the world, with over $3 billion in online gross transaction value.

In addition, Ravi is also a board director of Church &amp; Dwight, a major American manufacturer of household products best known for its Arm &amp; Hammer line.

Prior to joining Ritchie Bros., Ravi was CEO of OfficeMax. He also has more than 20 years of senior management experience at Aramark, InterContinental Hotels Group, and SC Johnson. Ravi has lived in six countries and worked in many more across five continents over his 38-year career, starting at Leo Burnett in Chicago. He earned an MBA from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and an electrical engineering degree from Bangalore University, India.

Ravi spoke with RHR Senior Partner David Astorino about his leadership skills, business philosophies, and views on building diverse cultures that have enabled him to effectively lead in very different industries. (<a href="https://chiefexecutive.net/want-to-spice-up-innovation-solve-your-gender-diversity-gap/">Click here</a> to read Ravi’s article in Chief Executive magazine: “Want to Spice Up Innovation? Solve Your Gender Diversity Gap.”)

<b>David: You adapt and lead effectively in very different industries. What is it about your leadership that enables you to be so effective in such unique and challenging environments?</b>

<b>Ravi:</b> While I have lacked domain expertise in many of the new industries, I have relied on my strong general management training and focused on the fundamentals. I’m like an outsider who's an insider, bringing an insatiable curiosity to what I do. What has made me effective:

Number one: I have unlimited reservoirs of energy and passion for brands. This was critical at Leo Burnett, and this is where I learned the importance of having a point of view. And that point of view had to be based on facts and the ability to defend yourself. That has shaped my style, and I expect it from my team as well.

Number two: I appreciate the importance of culture. Moving on to SC Johnson, I noted that the company was famous for its culture of being people oriented yet performance driven. It also had a very strong global mindset.

Number three: A service business is very different from packaged goods and consumer businesses, which is something I learned at the InterContinental Hotels Group. Here I learned the importance of the front line—your brand ambassadors whom you need to galvanize to deliver the value proposition.

Number four: The nitty-gritty details of operations are important. I learned this at Aramark, where there were thousands of associates under my remit. In a heavily operational business, such as food service, it is important to be both strategic and tactical several times in one day. Details matter!

Number five: Cash is king, which I learned at Aramark but applied at OfficeMax when I did my first real turnaround as a CEO. It is the core of the Ritchie Bros. model as well, which is focused on heavy equipment—the farthest from anything I've done.

Ritchie Bros. is a cash engine, and driving this is the key. In the last four years since I've taken over, we've doubled the cumulative operating free cash flow and grown the market capitalization of the company to USD $4.1 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion over the previous four years.

My guideposts at Ritchie Bros. and at all these companies have been driving <i>stakeholder value,</i> which includes three components: shareholder value, customer value, and employee value. You've got to keep all three in harmonious balance because they are interdependent.

Focusing on <i>all employees, </i>not just the superstars, is really important too. It is how you create pride and passion. Companies are actually made up of seemingly ordinary people who, in reality, have extraordinary potential; your job is to unleash the exponential power of those people and bring out the best in them.

And, coming back to your original question, industry expertise matters less at the CEO level if the industry is mature and being disrupted. Focus on customers, investors, and employees and watch out for disruptive forces. Find the drivers; use common sense. Listen — <i>and listen very hard </i>— because the people have the answers. Your job is to unlock them.

<b>David: You were born and raised in India, became an American citizen, have worked in many geographies, and now lead a Canadian company and have been named British Columbia’s CEO of the year. How has your global perspective shaped your leadership? </b>

<b>Ravi:</b> I chose advertising, consumer packaged goods, and marketing in the heartland of America. This was different from people who came from India to be doctors or scientists. (And, truth be told, I was an immigrant who came to this country with nine dollars in my pocket, all of which were borrowed.)

I was one of the very first Indians to be hired by Leo Burnett. During the interview they asked, "Why should we hire an Indian engineer with an MBA who doesn't have a green card? What can you bring us?" I spontaneously said, “I'll be objective, not have personal biases, and only be guided by the customer." Interestingly, this has become my mantra throughout the rest of my career.

First and foremost, I'd say I have developed into a good general manager because of my international training. In fact, I’ve lived in six countries and worked in 50. At 32, I joined SC Johnson, Korea, as the only foreigner. While my executives spoke okay English, much of the company didn't speak English. I had to learn enough Korean to communicate. This taught me not to judge my executives’ business acumen based on their English-speaking abilities. Another key learning for me was the importance of being authentic and genuine—you cannot be fake because people see through that. Rather than the spoken word, people look more at your facial expressions, your body language, and how you treat others.

My philosophy is that human beings across the planet are about 80 percent the same, and the remaining 20 percent is cultural differences. (<a href="https://chiefexecutive.net/best-worlds-brew-blended-culture/">Click here</a> to read Ravi’s article in <i>Chief Executive</i> magazine: “The Best of Both Worlds – How to Brew a Blended Culture.”) Too many executives lead with just their head. But to be successful in different cultures, you have to appeal to the heart as well. What people look for in a leader is caring, compassion, and someone who's going to guide them to some level of prosperity. They want to know that you're not selfish and that you worry more about others than about yourself. When you show consideration for people, they are willing to tolerate any cultural gaps you might have because they know you have a heart.

Lastly, I’d say that when leading in different geographies and cultures, you need to have clear values and integrity. I've put a lot of emphasis on <i>how</i> you do business, and integrity is at the center. I don’t compromise here because there are many situations where, as a leader, you can rationalize an action as adapting to a different culture, when in reality it is a compromise of your values.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is not one organization that isn’t feeling the pressure from growing market complexity, technological disruption, and an evolving workforce. It is obvious that having the right leadership is critical if organizations are to successfully weather the storm; however, the field is unfortunately replete with faddish models and concepts that obscure what leadership talent organizations actually need.

For instance, <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?cat=12&amp;date=today%205-y&amp;q=digital%20leadership">searches for “digital leadership” have continued to rise over the last five years</a>—reflecting people’s interest in how one can turn digital assets into strategic gain for their organization. But what does this really look like and how does it differ to what we already know about what makes a great leader? Examining the <a href="https://www.hoganassessments.co.uk/media/1682/what-we-know-about-leadership.pdf">scientific literature</a> reveals that a handful of psychological dispositions are consistent predictors of leadership emergence and effectiveness. It is unlikely that this would have drastically changed within a short span of time. That raises a much broader question: is the future of leadership assessment and development just “old wine in new bottles?”

Unpacking this question is of practical value, given that building great leaders takes significant time and effort. The ability to evaluate emerging leadership trends and how they relate to socio-economic factors is critical. When we look at leadership in the modern organization, there are three things we should know:
<h3>1. Leadership needs to adapt to changes in the way people are working.</h3>
The early 2000s saw many organizations getting comfortable with the presence of virtual teams; however, significant shifts in the way people are working are placing new pressures that leaders need to accommodate. As summarized in a recent report, some of the key <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/human-capital-trends.html">trends</a> in the workforce are centered around the growth of the freelance and gig economy, shifting demographics with millennials increasingly represented, and the already felt impact of automation and robotics, to name a few. Fundamentally, this is changing the employee/employer relationship as individuals have new expectations from work. Specifically, people increasingly want more <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/236438/millennials-jobs-development-opportunities.aspx">learning and development opportunities</a>, and more <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2017/06/09/why-millennials-want-more-than-just-work-the-importance-of-your-double-bottom-line/#3a7c305c5784">purposeful and meaningful employment</a>. Failing to deliver on these is a leading predictor of turnover. Leaders that fail to adapt and pivot their organizations to address these trends will cause their organization to stall, however, adapting and embracing such trends could lead to significant value creation.
<h3>2. Technology, data, and artificial intelligence are revolutionizing how we identify and develop leadership potential.</h3>
While the pressures on leadership have changed and pose new hurdles to overcome, fortunately, it has never been easier to identify and develop leadership potential. This is driven partly by a large body of scientific literature that has revealed consistent predictors in leadership potential and partly by an <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ryne_Sherman/publication/302977849_New_Talent_Signals_Shiny_New_Objects_or_a_Brave_New_World/links/574ddf9308aec988526bc263/New-Talent-Signals-Shiny-New-Objects-or-a-Brave-New-World.pdf">explosion in data-driven tools that can reliably and accurately detect the critical signals of leadership potential</a>. Moving beyond psychometric surveys, the digital footprint we all leave produces a wealth of data that can be mined for relevant insights through the use of artificial intelligence-based algorithms. For instance, a recent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886918302800">study found social media activity could accurately predict an individual’s dark side—a huge focus of leadership assessment.</a> When it comes to development, SaaS solutions, ChatBots and tools that continuously monitor behavior raise self-awareness and provide personalized development in real-time and at scale. The democratization of coaching and development will ensure organizations will have a large (and more importantly, diverse) pipeline of talent. So, while the challenges leaders face seems daunting, the ability to find suitable individuals to do such work should not be a source of stress.
<h3>3. The language of leadership has changed, but the foundational talents have (mostly) stayed the same.</h3>
It can be said that despite the new contextual factors that organizations are finding themselves in, the routine tasks of leaders are broadly the same as leaders from the 1980s. Specifically, the ability to set and execute a strategy, create value for customers and stakeholders, galvanize employees and inspire action, and so on. It’s for this reason that <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c52e/27d79e890a8fd8138495f5b7b8ff260f7b90.pdf">meta-analyses</a> find a handful of psychological dispositions to be consistent predictors of leadership effectiveness. What, then, is new and different for leadership?

First, many of the new talents that are discussed by HR practitioners and thought leaders can be seen as a more marketable versions of constructs that IO psychologists already know a lot about. What is new, therefore, is the language we use to describe leaders. For example, “<a href="https://insights.humancapital.aon.com/talent-assessment-blog/our-new-digital-competency-model-and-assessment-package">digital talent</a>” is thought to be comprised of three competencies: learnability, agility, and curiosity. Or in academic language, it is the need for cognition, cognitive flexibility, and trait openness—three dispositions that have been demonstrated to scientifically predict relevant work and leadership outcomes. Given that digital talent and its competencies are intuitive and easy to understand, as opposed to the academic counterparts, IO psychologists need to leave their ivory towers and do a better job at communicating existing scientific models and evidence. Doing so will reduce the duplication of efforts and enable practitioners to more effectively leverage a large body of scientific literature, ultimately improving decision making rather than investing resources into developing a derivative and not so-innovative model of leadership effectiveness.

Second, it is wrong to say that absolutely nothing has changed when it comes to leadership potential. New environmental factors call for other skills and talents leaders need to possess and sharpen: greater <a href="https://www.strategy-business.com/blog/Increasing-Your-Global-Fluency?gko=430ed">global fluency</a> and <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/03/teams-solve-problems-faster-when-theyre-more-cognitively-diverse">cognitive diversity</a>, adopting a <a href="http://www.hmieleski.com/Publications/Hmieleski_Ensley_JOB_2007.pdf">more entrepreneurial and proactive mindset</a> to stave off competition from smaller and more nimble competitors, and improve <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2017/07/11/why-resilience-is-necessary-as-a-leader/#99a367e4ad38">resilience and emotional management</a> given the flood of demands and pressure placed on their time. Organizational leaders have always had to adapt their leadership to new market conditions, but our perspective is that these changes are much bigger and faster than they used to be. Although the platform of traits associated with great leadership may be relatively static, the business environment is pulling for specific leadership requirements that need to be honed and elevated above others. Specifically:
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1">The ability to lead business transformation and change.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">The ability to perceive digital business requirements and engage the marketplace in new and innovative ways.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">The ability to be agile: to flex, adapt, and quickly respond to the ever-increasing demands associated with change and the ambiguity it creates.</li>
</ol>
Sure, these dispositions have always been advantageous in the workplace, but what we see from our clients across industry segments is that they are growing in importance and are increasingly elevated above other leadership capabilities.

To return to our original question, is the future of leadership old wine in new bottles, our perspective is that there are stable leadership capabilities that are necessary across all contexts that stand the test of time—the “old but good wine” such as self-awareness, authenticity, strong critical thinking capabilities, and so on. Other traits, such as learning agility and the ability to lead business transformation perhaps fall into the “old wine” category also, but our belief is that these traits, in addition to digital leadership capabilities, are becoming increasingly elevated in importance and critical “must-haves.” The pressure to shift and change more rapidly given global pressures and the sense that competition can come from a multitude of new venues pushes for greater leadership agility, the ability to lead through ambiguity, and the development of digital capabilities to support business delivery in new and innovative ways. To exhaust the wine analogy, we’re in an era of complex blends—leadership is still about charting a direction for an organization, engaging people, and self-management, but what is critical across those dimensions is becoming increasingly apparent.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Boards and management teams have distinct roles in their partnerships to maximize the success of the enterprises that they lead. Over the past couple of years, RHR has conducted board evaluations with more than 200 individual directors and members of management teams who interface with board committees. In the interviews, we asked management teams about their experiences working with directors and for recommendations on how their boards can enhance their value proposition. Here are the some of the things we consistently heard.

<b>1. Do your homework to understand our business thoroughly</b>

Management teams usually spend many hours preparing for board meetings. One of the top frustrations they express is responding to directors’ questions—or worse, suggested actions—that reflect a lack of understanding about the company’s real business context and challenges. Conversely, management teams genuinely value questions from directors who offer perspectives and counsel informed by a thorough grasp of the competitive landscape and the key drivers of the P&amp;L. This first point suggests that companies need to ensure a very robust onboarding and continuing education process to equip directors with the knowledge they need to contribute in a meaningful way. Doing so allows directors to best prepare for board and committee meetings. Simply browsing through the board book on the plane on the way to meetings doesn’t cut it anymore. Directors need to be continual students of the organizations they govern and be proactive in making sure they have the information they need to really understand the key issues management teams are grappling with.

<b>2. Help us think through strategic options</b>

Whether in committee meetings or full board sessions, too often agendas are devoted to reporting or “show and tell” presentations by management teams to update directors on the business. The underlying assumption is to demonstrate to the board that management is on top of their responsibility in running the company. Given the challenging environment that organizations function within these days, more and more management teams (and boards for that matter) are asking for less agenda time focused on report-outs and more time for discussion of key strategic issues. To accomplish this, all the information to update the directors on company performance should be sent to directors in advance of meetings, along with some key questions or issues that the management team would like the board’s input on. This allows for less time spent in board and committee meetings informing directors, leaving more time for strategic discussion.

<b>3. Hold us accountable but let us handle the day-to-day management of the organization</b>

In their effort to be helpful and add value, sometimes directors cross the line drawn by their governance role into the management realm. While directors can sometimes add value (when invited to do so), by making suggestions about <i>how</i> to execute, management teams often get frustrated when board members exert their power by directing executive team members on execution. Clarity about the respective roles and decision rights of boards and management leads to the most efficient division of labor and minimizes mixed messages and inefficiency. Individual directors need to be very thoughtful about how they insert themselves in any operational matters, if at all.

<b>4. Leverage your network on our behalf</b>

Several CEOs we work with refer to their board members as invaluable resources to open doors through the relationships they have cultivated over the years. Whether with regulators, potential customers, key suppliers, or domain experts, the best directors have a network of contacts that are relevant to the company’s business and are able to make warm introductions to key stakeholders in the organization’s ecosystem. While this is always a welcome contribution, it is especially valuable in start-ups and younger enterprises and can even be an essential requirement in composing the board and inboard succession planning.

<b>5. Invest in our learning and development </b>

Boards of directors are ideally composed of highly experienced and seasoned business leaders. Almost to a person, the management team members we have interviewed told us they deeply appreciate directors who take the time and effort to get to know them and who are committed to their ongoing development. While primary responsibility for talent and career development resides with the CEO, CHRO, and with the executives themselves, many CEOs and executives rate their boards more highly when their interactions with directors offer new ideas and perspectives that enrich them. Some boards go so far as to set up mentoring opportunities for management team members with selected board members.

The CEOs and management team members we work with certainly understand and respect the role and responsibility of boards to hold them accountable. By adopting the recommendations suggested above, directors can extend their contributions in supporting and sustaining the best performance by management over time.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What do those who work the closest with CEOs, those on their senior teams, <i>really </i>want their leader to change? We analyzed feedback from 174 C-suite level executives from 40 different organizations gathered between 2015–2018 as part of RHR’s Senior Team Effectiveness Survey. We found that when given the opportunity to provide anonymous feedback to their bosses, members of the top team focused the most on the following advice: (1) be more transparent, (2) help us stay focused, (3) hold us accountable, (4) spend more time coaching and developing us, and (5) be decisive.
<h3>1. Increase transparency to engage and develop the top team</h3>
While effective communication tends to be a top feedback theme for many executives, CEO teams desire more transparency. There is a sense that the leader may be holding back, even if unintentionally, and they want more transparency to understand and learn the rationale for decisions and actions. As part of consistent open and honest dialogue, team members also want their voices to be heard and not fall on deaf ears.

Examples of feedback:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Keep communicating! Try to be a bit more transparent. You can be really hard to read.</i></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Listen more and understand the value derived from the experience of the team.</i></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>I wish the CEO would spend more time making transparent his criteria for success rather than weighing in on the details.</i></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Be open about sharing your expectations with us. This will ensure trust in you as a leader and enforce the respect we have for you.</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Increase focus on strategy and prioritization</h3>
Choosing what to ultimately focus on and staying the course is no easy feat. Nevertheless, team members encourage CEOs to push for a clear strategy and to help them define and refine a limited number of priorities aligned with the strategy to stay focused.

Examples of feedback:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Needs to stay more focused and prioritize better.</i></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Spend much more time on the overall strategy of the company.</i></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Focus on the strategy, people, activities, and priorities to ensure we drive the right results and achieve the best profitability.</i></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Help us focus on the strategic roadmap of where we need to go rather than only financials.</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Foster greater ownership and accountability</h3>
In addition to helping the team stay focused on clear priorities, holding them accountable was another piece of advice provided by those in the C-suite to their CEOs. Ultimately it is the CEO’s job to make sure leaders are aligned on expectations and held accountable for following through on their commitments.

Examples of feedback:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Do a better job of holding the team and individuals accountable for performance.</i></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Drive more accountability at the senior level.</i></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>When we fail, we need to have an honest discussion about why, and someone needs to take responsibility. We need more accountability to outcomes.</i></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Where possible, work to align applicable members of your team to a clear and focused set of expectations and focus on holding them accountable.</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Coach and develop</h3>
Senior team members also chose to anonymously ask their CEOs to spend more time on coaching and development. They look to their leader to not only lead them but to spend the necessary time providing guidance on how <i>they</i> can improve as a leader.

Examples of feedback:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Care more about people than process; leadership is about helping people reach places they didn’t know they could go.</i></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Invest in more one-on-one time with each team member to help them develop and grow.</i></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Spend quality time with team members, share your expectations, coach, and grow them.</i></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Improve feedback to individual members. Take an active interest in team member development. Support resources needed to deliver goals. Ensure all team members’ skills are fully used.</i></li>
</ul>
<h3>5. Improve decision making</h3>
Decision-making is a critical aspect of leadership, so it is no surprise that senior team members advised CEOs to work on its various aspects. The importance of decision-making was recently highlighted in a <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/intentionality-and-decision-making-senior-team">blog post</a> written in conjunction with my colleague David Astorino. From confidently making tough decisions to empowering the team to make decisions, many team members felt that their CEOs had areas of decision-making that could be improved.

Examples of feedback:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Be clear when you have made up your mind about something.</i></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Bring more of the senior team into key decision-making processes and bring them in much earlier in the process.</i></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Empower your smart teammates to come up with solutions.</i></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Take more decisive action.</i></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Not all decisions need consensus. In some areas where you’ve made your mind up, it’s faster and more effective just to say what you decided and move on.</i></li>
</ul>
The advice anonymously provided to CEOs by their team reflects the key actions of senior leadership. The data collected underscores the importance of communication, setting strategy and prioritization, accountability, coaching and development, and decision making for CEOs and their senior teams. When CEOs take steps to improve in these five areas, they can more broadly help their teams be more effective in these areas as well.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When it comes to identifying and selecting talent, leaders now have more tools at their disposal than ever before. Until recently, the main ways we assessed people were through the use of CVs, interviews, and if lucky, a psychometric survey. Putting aside the debate around the accuracy and utility of such tools, they all share something in common—they rely on human judgment. When it comes to identifying the right person for the role, human judgment can really get in the way:
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1">We are prone to cognitive biases, heuristics, and assumptions. As described by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, the more an individual declares themselves to be a good judge of talent, the less likely that is to be true.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Of those people that are good judges of talent, they can’t be scaled to match the demand or complexity of the modern economy.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">We all struggle to make sense of complex sources of data and make accurate predictions about the future. In our case, one’s potential to thrive at work.</li>
</ol>
Fortunately, talent identification is undergoing a revolution. This is a result of the democratization and consumerization of Artificial Intelligence and related technologies, making it easier to train and implement predictive models and algorithms within HR and leadership practice. For example, there are numerous solutions on the market that use some form of AI to improve our talent decisions: using <a href="https://www.pymetrics.com/employers/">games</a> to measure decision-making preferences and cognitive ability, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/didnt-get-the-job-the-robots-may-not-have-liked-your-social-media-activity/94228433-78FE-4BA3-939C-B6B15690FB58.html">social media and linguistic scrapers</a>, and <a href="https://www.hirevue.com/">video interviews</a> to mine prosody and body language. Such tools enable practitioners to accurately identify talent at scale, in a speedy fashion, and free of bias. So, while leaders of organizations are using these tools to identify and staff talent for junior or middle-management roles, how can such innovations be used to build a strong bench of senior and executive leadership?

Before I answer this question, I want to make a few things clear. First, I do not think leaders will ever, nor should, be selected solely on the basis of an AI tool. Second, I do not see a future where leadership consultants will be replaced by an algorithm. But as the adage goes, you can’t manage what you can’t measure. Not leveraging AI tools or novel sources of data leaves considerable value on the table—ultimately reducing our ability to help our clients and their organizations. With that said, the AI revolution—bringing technology, data, and prediction—will have a positive impact on leadership assessment in three ways:
<h2>Identify the talent signals that matter at scale.</h2>
Leadership assessment is rightfully “high-touch” with a candidate spending a considerable amount of time with a practitioner as they explore past experiences, expertise, and relative strengths and weaknesses. While such an approach is entirely appropriate, the talent identification trends that are happening in lower parts of the organization can give us a strong sense of how we can enhance the way we assess current and future leaders.

Most leadership assessments currently rely on in-depth interviews 360-assessments and long psychometric instruments. While these tools are scientifically validated and intuitive, it can be argued that they do not capture all the necessary talent signals, nor can they be truly scaled to meet the demand of the multinational firms and “VUCA” environments. In the not too distant future, we will be leveraging AI tools to further enhance our understanding due to their ability to process rich and voluminous data that we have traditionally been unable to collect or understand. Their automatic nature will also enable us to assess such talent at scale. We can already see examples of this as there are solutions that can deduce talent signals from the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Winsborough/publication/317394924_The_datafication_of_talent_how_technology_is_advancing_the_science_of_human_potential_at_work/links/59f27d7b0f7e9beabfcc6496/The-datafication-of-talent-how-technology-is-advancing-the-science-of-human-potential-at-work.pdf">words we write, the things we say, and our digital footprint</a>. Such tools will not replace human decision-making, rather, <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/07/how-ai-will-change-the-way-we-make-decisions">they will make the process of assessment and prediction significantly cheaper while ultimately producing insights that significantly improve human judgment</a>.
<h2>Increase demographic and cognitive diversity.</h2>
Many organizations are proactively trying to increase minority representation and foster more inclusive work environments. Nonetheless, organizations still have a long way to go, as <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/06/16/why-we-logged-every-fortune-500-companys-diversity-data-or-lack-thereof/">70% of senior executives at Fortune 500 companies are white men.</a> Similarly, there is a growing cause for an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomaspremuzic/2018/09/03/the-case-for-boosting-cognitive-diversity-in-organizations/#1e6e24e32b69">increase in cognitive or “deep” diversity amongst the leadership</a>. Cognitive diversity describes <a href="https://journals.aom.org/doi/abs/10.5465/256901">variation in the ways people think, feel, and act</a>, as well as how such differences positively interact within group contexts. Groups that <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/03/teams-solve-problems-faster-when-theyre-more-cognitively-diverse">have cognitive diversity</a> are more likely to view problems differently, produce better decisions, and have complementary dispositions.

Here, AI tools can have a significant impact, as, unlike humans, they can be trained to be “blind” to demographic factors and instead focus on identifying the characteristics, qualities, and skills that are actually required to become a successful leader. Sure, AI assessments have been found to display <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/10/17958784/ai-recruiting-tool-bias-amazon-report">forms of bias in talent selection</a>, yet we should ask ourselves whether such tools are <i>less</i> biased than human raters (<a href="https://hbr.org/2018/07/want-less-biased-decisions-use-algorithms">the answer is yes</a>) and whether the issue will be resolved as the technologies mature (there is no reason to believe otherwise).
<h2>Support continuous development and self-awareness.</h2>
Without knowing where one’s leadership strengths and limitations are, any effort to create lasting behavior change is futile. The key to leadership development, therefore, starts with self-awareness, or as Socrates said, “know thyself”. Data-driven tools, that leverage technologies such as <a href="https://www.saberr.com/coachbot">ChatBots</a>, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3051324/we-spent-two-weeks-wearing-employee-trackers-heres-what-we-learned">wearable devices</a>, and <a href="https://qz.com/1078857/apples-siri-job-posting-seeks-engineers-with-psychology-skills-to-improve-its-counseling-abilities/">AI-powered assistants</a> such as those that currently live in our pockets (i.e. think Siri), have the potential to not only raise our self-awareness but also provide us with personalized and real-time feedback on how one can become a better leader. Think I’m crazy? Take a look at the <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/gary_wolf_the_quantified_self?language=en">quantified-self movement</a>, and the huge adoption of fitness trackers and smartwatches to improve both our <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5688726/">physical</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/self-care-apps-are-booming/">psychological</a> health. “Always-on” technologies that can mine our behaviors, and then provide us instant feedback and practical advice on how we can modify our behavior, will close the gap between leadership assessment and development as distinct practices. Ultimately improving the effectiveness of both.

To quote Ajay Agrawal, author of<i> Prediction Machines</i>, “Artificial Intelligence does not actually bring us intelligence but instead a critical component of intelligence—prediction.” As such, without good predictions, we cannot make good judgments. AI will not replace humans (nor consultants), it will only make us better.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At RHR International, we have the privilege of talking to people every day about topics related to leadership. One of RHR’s core values is that leadership is a noble endeavor and, when done well, is a force for good in the world. With that in mind, we engaged our clients and contacts on the question of the challenges of leading in a complex environment. More specifically, we asked them:

<i>What is the one trait or one quality that you think is most important to demonstrate as a leader in an environment of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA), and why? </i>

There was a lot of interest in the topic, with responses grouped along with five main topic areas.
<ol>
 	<li>First, many people touched on the theme of focus and decisiveness. Perhaps the following best sums it up:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Despite all that is changing and the chaos around you, focusing on the few most critical things rallies the organization around what’s most important.</li>
</ul>
And there was a warning:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Too often a VUCA environment drives leaders off course and into chasing the "shiny object" reactively. Leaders can quickly turn off those they are leading if people can't see alignment with the vision/mission and strategy.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
 	<li>Besides the importance of focusing on the key priorities, we also heard a lot about the inspirational component of leadership in times of turbulence:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Leadership is fundamentally defined as helping people understand that they can achieve the impossible.</li>
</ul>
Not easy to do, but it is a valuable reminder that good leadership goes well beyond the mechanics of goal setting and accountability.
<ol start="3">
 	<li>And some felt that curiosity and openness to new options and solutions were key.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Being curious about solutions and technology and the changing world is paramount, especially as the uncertainty swirling around you will cause you to retreat to the relative comfort of the tried-and-true.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
 	<li>Aligned with the need to be inspirational, the leader’s credibility and trustworthiness were also mentioned.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">If the organization can trust that their leader will follow through, be steadfast in their word, be reliable, and do whatever they say they are going to do, it implies that not only has a relationship been built, but the leader has established a pattern of behavior that can be trusted, even in the most challenging of circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
 	<li>The importance of resilience was also raised.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Resiliency and grit are critical. In our always-changing and rapidly evolving markets, you have to have a leader who is able to show up consistently with energy and optimism to help employees deliver their best every day.</li>
</ul>
Our clients’ leadership is being tested, and yours is no doubt being tested as well. As we launch into 2019, these insights provide a useful checklist to help keep you and your teams centered and able to tackle whatever the year may bring.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As we ring in the new year, we may feel as though we’re given a free pass to absolve ourselves from what we <i>didn’t</i> accomplish last year, and to resolve to make this year better than ever before. But sticking to those resolutions is hard work, and just as maintaining personal resolutions takes concerted focus and effort to form new habits, the same can be said for making resolutions stick in your organization.

Since senior leaders are the ones responsible for driving organizational change, the onus for keeping the resolution resides with them. As part of RHR’s <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/leadership-services/senior-team-effectiveness">Senior Team Effectiveness</a> Survey, we ask those individuals who lead the business or enterprise for feedback on their team’s overall effectiveness. We also ask for their input on how specifically their team could be more effective at driving organizational change.

Based on data from <b>400</b> senior team members in over <b>100</b> different organizations and <b>15</b> different industries, here are the “organizational change resolutions” that rose to the top:

<b>1. Get comfortable with being uncomfortable</b>

Forming new habits often requires a marked shift in operating, and at times, this change may cause a little heartburn. However, as with anything, consistent practice can make actions or behaviors more habitual over time. Many respondents noted the importance of embracing the uncomfortable for the sake of continuous improvement. Such behaviors included: (a) adopting a more open environment built on honesty and the willingness to candidly discuss new ideas, (b) creating a safe space to provide constructive criticism, engage in healthy debate, and provide feedback to learn from past projects/interactions, and (c) becoming more risk-tolerant, failing fast, and encouraging innovative ideas.

<b>2. Find power in clarity</b>

As uncertainty can be a major source of tension during organizational change, getting everyone on the same page to prepare for the road ahead was another common solution to effectively leading the organization through the transition. Leaders emphasized the importance of providing crisp, clear, and consistent communication to all levels of the organization to provide transparency and ensure that all employees are aligned in the change. They also underscored the necessity of understanding the unique attributes that drive each business unit, function, or region, and ensuring these groups are working together collectively instead of as a series of individual parts.

<b>3. Develop and groom talent that you can believe in</b>

Senior executives need to be able to create the long-term vision for the organization and steer the ship in the right direction to actualize long-term goals, but that becomes a challenge when they are consistently having to lend attention to lower-level problems and firefighting. For this reason, many have stated the importance of retaining key players, developing the next generation of leaders, and eliminating poor performers. Having confidence in the next level leadership to make decisions and empowering them to do so allows the senior leadership team to have a greater focus on more strategic issues and ensure that the organization as a whole remains on target.

And finally,

<b>4. Don’t procrastinate!</b>

One leader stated it best when he/she said, “Those who don’t change get left behind.” With the pace of technological advances happening faster than ever before, waiting to find the right time to start making changes is not an option. Those who will be most successful are able to prioritize what is most important and set a pace that is swift but does not overwhelm employees. Those able to quickly adapt, embrace technology and innovation, and align resources appropriately will have the advantage. After all, the last thing you would want is to let another December roll around before you’ve realized that the resolutions you made at the beginning of the year are the ones that you’ll be carrying into the next year as well.

Sticking to organizational resolutions is a challenge, especially when they involve great change. But navigating that challenge clears the way on the path to successful transformation and a prosperous year.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This year at RHR International, we covered many topics on leadership. Here are the top blog posts as of 2018 according to readers.

1. <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/employee-turnover-why-good-people-leave">Employee Turnover: Why Good People Leave</a>

As a leader, it is particularly painful when top talent chooses to leave the company. Learn why good employees leave and find out how companies can retain key staff.

2. <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/gender-bias-balancing-tightrope">Gender Bias: Balancing on the Tightrope</a>

The tightrope refers to the need for women to master a balancing act between being seen as too masculine to be likable and too feminine to be competent—and ultimately respected—and is the bias most commonly experienced by female executives.

3. <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/managing-power-top">Managing Power at the Top</a>

Managing influence and power at the top is not a given, yet the ability to do this well will be a make-or-break factor for the leader and the organization. To help CEOs sort out whether they are managing power effectively, it is helpful to understand the ways power is mismanaged.

4. <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/intentionality-and-decision-making-senior-team">Intentionality and Decision Making in the Senior Team</a>

Effective leadership often comes down to two critical and complex tasks: making good decisions and engaging others to execute those decisions. Making good decisions at the upper level requires a deep understanding of how optimal decision-making occurs as well as the pitfalls.

5. <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/foolish-things-leaders-do">Foolish Things Leaders Do</a>

We know you’re no fool. You’re insightful and decisive. You blow away your quarterly goals while keeping your company well-positioned for the next few decades. So fill up that Best Boss Ever mug and read on, thinking about people you know who may need this advice.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This holiday season includes an unusual number of C-suite leadership transitions. Some have been triggered by company performance or executive behavior. Others are due to shifts in the business model, planned succession moves, or the unexpected departure of individual senior executives. Without question, these changes can help poise an organization for higher levels of performance. However, they can also create distractions, anxiety, and unintended consequences. Given that changes in leadership—both planned and unplanned—are a reality, how can boards, CEOs, and senior executives maximize the benefits while minimizing the costs?

During the selection period of a CEO succession process, it is easy for boards to underestimate the need to provide overt TLC to the key leaders they want to retain. After all, it should be obvious to a high-performing executive the extent to which he or she is valued by the board. But unless this person is on the list of potential successors, the need to state the obvious may move to the bottom of a chairman’s or lead director’s long to-do list. For situations involving an interim CEO or when the current CEO’s retirement is announced well in advance in order to launch an external search, addressing the inevitable anxiety created among the rest of the senior team can help minimize distractions and keep the business on track.

For planned succession moves within a company, a not-so-obvious risk is embedded when a superstar is being moved out of a current role and the intent is to backfill with someone who is less of a heavy hitter. It is easy to take for granted what the incumbent brought to the role and assume this level of impact is a given moving forward, only to find that this is not the case. What may prove more helpful is for CEOs and their CHROs to proactively note the additional processes or structure that will reduce the role complexity, identify external support to help provide needed expertise or perspective, or narrow the responsibilities initially and then broaden over time as the new executive grows into the role.

Senior executives who are considering a transition should ensure they step back to take stock before selecting the next adventure. A high-level leadership role can consume most of an executive’s focus and energy. Before responding to the siren’s call of the next role, executives should ensure that they are clear regarding their goals, both career and personal. And, they should include their spouse or significant other in these musings. Priorities evolve for all of us; the more explicit these are, the easier it is to make good choices and come to terms with the inevitable trade-offs. Finally, the executive should note when he/she last moved to a new company. If this was not within the last five years, the executive should revisit what it takes to transplant well to a new ecosystem and potentially seek additional support.

The logical aspects of transitions have been well documented and are identifiable through solid planning. By paying attention to the nuances, seemingly little things, CEOs, board members, and senior executives can help maximize the perceived value of the “gift” to their organizations of a new leader.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Assuming the top leadership role in an organization is a life-changing experience filled with emotions ranging from exhilaration to a feeling of isolation. Whether you are a founder who just launched your own company, a Fortune 100 CEO, or somewhere in between, this can be a daunting experience. Here are some quick tips as you embark on this journey.
<h3>Invest heavily in your team</h3>
Assess your team to determine where an upgrade in talent is necessary and act swiftly to make changes. Set a goal to have your team in place within 12 months. Then, identify what’s unique about the work of your senior executive team, set the agenda, and define how you will work with the team and how the team will work together. Implement a regular cadence of focusing on strategic initiatives while breaking down silos to improve cross-functional relationships.
<h3>Shape the culture</h3>
This is important for any CEO, but particularly in companies that have experienced rapid growth and where culture and values have not been deliberately established. Ask yourself questions such as, “What behaviors must my leaders consistently demonstrate? How would I want the external market to experience my company?” Then, identify a concise set of values, behaviors, and attitudes that you expect the organization to embody. Use this during the hiring process and in driving performance.
<h3>Manage key stakeholders</h3>
Identify the key stakeholders who are essential to your success (e.g., board of directors, investors, partners, customers). Determine the unique needs and dynamics of these constituent groups. Make a plan to address each group including how often to hold meetings, how best to influence each group, and hot-button issues. Get crystal clear regarding the outcomes that will be the markers of your success for each group.
<h3>Manage yourself and identify what is unique</h3>
As the CEO, you set the tone for the rest of the organization with the behavior that you model. Cultivate internal (self) and external (other) awareness because these are the links that ensure you are connecting your intent to your impact. Take time and recharge to ensure you model composure and resilience in times of extreme pressure. Determine where you add the most value to the organization. This may appear obvious at first glance, but as you ascend to the top job it is critical to reflect on what you achieved to get here and how you were effective. Identify the things that only you can do and use this to guide you on where to focus your time. You may also discover that some of the skills that got you here need to be checked at the door for you to advance your goals.
<h3>Seek a cadre of truth-tellers</h3>
Taking the top role in an organization can be a lonely experience, and those who surround you will now treat you differently. This underpins the difficulty in obtaining unvarnished feedback. Therefore, identify truth tellers (either those on your team or trusted external advisors) who are willing to tell the emperor he or she has no clothes. Seek feedback and thought partnership from these advisors regularly. Be sure to pause and reflect on what you learn from these individuals and collect more data when necessary.

Regardless of the size or revenue of your company, the role of CEO presents enormous opportunities regarding your potential impact. While there is no blueprint for success as CEO, leveraging the strengths that brought you to the role while increasing awareness about your areas of development will lay a firm foundation.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While I have your attention, let’s (not) talk about what makes a good development plan.

After years of working with executives, the question of what goes into a good development plan frequently comes up and can be a frustrating one for two reasons: the first is that there are as many options for good development plans as there are leaders; second, and most important, is that it’s the wrong question to be asking.

Development plans are not inherently ineffective tools to support the growth of an individual—nothing beats a strong, meaningful SMART goal with the demonstrable history of holding people accountable for making adjustments—but if development plans alone were the key to sustainable behavior change, then it’s likely I would have very little work to do and very few of these conversations.

The reality is that many leaders are operating beyond capacity, stretched beyond what is reasonable in terms of time and resources, both mentally and emotionally. This means that any additional task or goal is tossed onto the big pile of things to do—along with the sleep deprivation and stress that are the frequent partners to most leaders. So, my answer to the question of what makes a good development plan and how to make meaningful sustainable behavior change is to start with shifting the mindset towards intentional self-reflection. And please, say no to the narrow definition of development plans and say yes to a significant inventory of what’s working or not working.

I take an efficient model approach to my executive coaching and advisory work. I want to clear people’s mental space so that they have to put in less effort, find more ease, and perhaps experience a bit more joy in what they have chosen to do every day. This space allows for presence, intentional decision making, and the pause often necessary for self-reflective conversations. The secret to change that lasts is a simple three-part equation. First, help leaders understand who they are and how they are impacting others—something I often refer to as “intent vs. impact”. Next, help them see who they could be by leveraging strengths, shifting beliefs, and stopping what’s not working. Create space to focus on their potential to influence, shape, and lead the business and their teams. The fancy word used to describe this is often “purpose.” Finally, create a <i>simple</i> development plan with actionable but attainable goals that build confidence toward this improved version of themselves.

So the irony is that the more salient question is not <i>what</i> but <i>when</i> is the right time for a good development plan. My answer is simple: when leaders are mentally focused on what success means for them and can see a clear path to get there.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many senior leaders consider ways they can define and transform their organization’s culture. However, there are so many definitions of and frameworks for an <i>organizational culture</i> that it can be difficult to align on the best way to truly affect measurable change. For example, some define organizational culture as the shared values and beliefs that contribute to a company's norms for what behavior is acceptable; others describe it as the customs and written and unwritten rules that have developed over time. These broad, conceptual definitions, along with many others, make selecting the appropriate change levers a challenge. One approach to creating culture change that stimulates higher productivity and performance is to focus on the <i>operating culture</i>.

A company’s operating culture is broadly defined as “the way we do things around here.”  When approaching change from the perspective of the operating culture (instead of culture), leaders can easily identify levers that affect how work gets done. For example, are employees encouraged to develop or share ideas for improving how work gets done? Are they recognized and rewarded for these ideas? Are there mechanisms in place that support effective planning? Is there a process within the organization for modifying initiatives as priorities shift? Thinking about how work gets done can trigger good questions, such as: How innovative are we? How proactive are we? How flexible are we? These types of questions can promote decisions and actions by leaders that accelerate real change inside an organization.

The next time someone asks you if it is possible to change organizational culture, respond by saying that that is the wrong question. The real question is: can leaders identify the strengths and gaps in their organization’s operating culture? If so, they can begin to leverage what is working and address what is not in order to drive change and alter operating behaviors and processes across the organization. Impacting how work gets done can help shift the operating culture and ultimately change the outcomes that matter]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is often said you can only learn how to run the second half of a marathon when you’ve run at least one race. Nothing can prepare you for your reaction when you have to dig deep for the first time.

As mentioned in <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/succession-planning-21st-century-talent-part-1">part one</a> of this blog post, predicting and then developing talent in the 21st century is not a skill for the faint-hearted. First, you need to know what you’re looking for and second, you need to know what to do with the talent once you’ve found it. Indeed, when we think about retaining and developing talent today—whether this is your first 21st-century talent mission or not—there are some tactics to put in play if you want to be successful.

A future-looking succession planning process should:
<h3>Take more risks and move with pace</h3>
There is a strong need to take more risks to move people more quickly through the pipeline; you can’t take a long view of talent progression with a rigid, slow promotions process.

You need to reduce the number of boxes someone must check to move to the next level and focus more on capability and potential than a series of required steps that slow down progress.
<h3>Re-think how “performance” is tracked and monitored</h3>
Performance alone becomes an increasingly insufficient measure for future potential; it’s generally too present-focused to give a sense of how someone will manage the demands of the future. You need to be targeted against defined development needs of leading at more scale.
<h3>Become creative in your talent moves—where you’re going there may not be paths</h3>
Creativity becomes more important in succession planning, e.g., considering people for roles that aren’t the obvious next steps and giving leaders broad exposure and temporary assignments.

We are seeing more skip-generation promotions where executives leap the obvious long-term groomed successor to find interesting talent options deeper in the organization.
<h3>Know who has skin in the game; be clear on who “owns” the talent</h3>
There is more need than ever to own some portion of talent from the center (enterprise talent) to ensure an element of critical hires are long-term hires rather than narrow, manager-driven, short-term ones.
<h3>Be ready for the bumps in the road!</h3>
Companies need a clear model of future-oriented talent that will likely challenge traditional assumptions and beliefs; this will naturally create conflict in talent roundtables. What a hiring manager may celebrate (e.g., solid and consistent delivery) may well be in conflict with what is needed (productive disruption, independent thinking, courage)—plus these people can be hard to manage!
<h3>Understand that money can buy talent</h3>
Companies are increasingly going outside to buy the types of talent they can’t find internally; it’s not a bad strategy, but it only works when the internal culture and support systems shift to adapt and fully integrate and accelerate the new kinds of talent.
<h3>Don’t bake the bread without the yeast</h3>
It’s tempting to create a process shaped with a long list of the who, what, how, and when, and stop there. Alas, if we forget the ‘why’, we are short-changing the recipe!

If we want leaders of the 21st century to rise to the top, we have to be in tune with their personal mission. Success means the realization of a <i>shared</i> vision.

The succession journey has to be values and mission purposed for the next generation of leaders. To go beyond and increase performance, people need to feel autonomous. Our desire to be self-directed and trusted, step-changes our engagement and contribution over compliance. Above all, the aspiring leaders of tomorrow have a desire to do something that has meaning and is important.

Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is predicting and developing 21st century talent. Taking on the mission?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I work with a CHRO who once described her company’s succession planning process as “all ornaments and no tree.” On the surface, her feedback might seem somewhat surprising. After all, the company conducted biannual talent management roundtables during which its top 200 or so leaders (and their viability as possible successors for enterprise-critical roles) were discussed in detail. Prior to the roundtable, a dashboard for each leader was constructed consisting of a 9-box score, notable strengths and development needs, potential derailers, and competency ratings based on the company’s leadership model. During the roundtable, development actions for leaders were identified and succession charts updated, designating candidates as “ready now,” “ready in 1–2 years,” or “ready in 3–5 years” for a particular role.

So why, exactly, did the CHRO describe the approach, which is very typical of that used by many organizations, as “all ornaments and no tree?” Essentially, she was criticizing the process for lacking the substance that only objective data and rigorous analysis can provide. Indeed, a deeper look at the company’s succession planning process reveals a number of critical shortcomings. While useful in many respects, the company’s competency model had been built around more general capabilities instead of those required to lead at scale. As a result, it lacked precision as a predictor of future success in roles of increased scope and complexity. Compounding the issue, in its efforts to assess potential, the company was overindexing on prior performance along with a leader’s ability to curry the favor of key decision makers. In evaluating possible successors, the organization neglected to delineate and then evaluate candidates against the critical experiences needed for a given role. An absence of detailed analytics obscured the fact that several leaders had been identified as potential successors for as many as three or more roles. The organization’s leadership pipeline was a proverbial house of cards that was overly dependent on a small number of viable successors.

As mentioned, the approach described above is all too common. Perhaps more so than at any other time, CEOs, other senior leaders, and even boards of directors are emphasizing the importance of building a robust pipeline of talent for enterprise-critical roles. But many organizations are unclear on exactly how to make their succession planning process more data driven and evidence based. Here, we offer recommendations for how to do so based on our work with clients who have successfully established best-in-class solutions for succession management. These organizations invest heavily in cultivating a strong pipeline of talent for the future. By doing so, they create a differentiating source of competitive advantage in their respective industries.

&nbsp;
<h3>Focus on the right capabilities</h3>
&nbsp;

The well-known book title <i>What Got You Here Won’t Get You There:</i> <i>How Successful People Become Even More Successful</i> succinctly summarizes perhaps the most common mistake made by organizations in succession management. There is a specific and unique set of capabilities that is essential to success in enterprise-leadership roles. However, in evaluating the viability of potential successors, most companies neglect to focus on these capabilities as much as they should. Instead, individuals are assessed against the company’s existing leadership or competency model. Because such models tend to be broadly focused on leadership at multiple levels in an organization, they invariably lack precision as predictors of success in enterprise-level roles. To increase precision, companies should assess candidates for succession against the following capabilities.

&nbsp;
<h3>Leading the business: Establishing strategy to position the enterprise for both near- and long-term success</h3>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Seeing the Whole – </i>Translating the broader landscape (enterprise, market, industry, regulatory, customer) into behaviors and actions that will drive enterprise objectives</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Making Systems Decisions – </i>Moving to decisions in the face of enterprise-level risk, competing priorities, limited resources, and diverse stakeholders</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Leading the Future –</i> Balancing the need to build confidence and drive outcomes in the near term with building momentum and capability for the long term</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Leading people: Operationalizing strategy and leading increasingly diverse constituents in ways that maximize discretionary effort and performance</h3>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Focusing the Enterprise – </i>Creating an overarching framework within which others can execute effectively</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Influencing with Power – </i>Driving alignment among diverse stakeholders and delivering compelling messages that move people to action</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Creating Shared Values – </i>Boldly setting the tone <i>from the top</i> that shapes decisions, behaviors, and interactions throughout the enterprise</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Leading self: Demonstrating healthy, agile, and resilient habits and learning to thrive in challenging and rapidly changing environments</h3>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Reasoning with Agility – </i>Connecting ideas and information in a flexible and fluid manner; learning and integrating new information in ever-changing circumstances</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Thriving in High Stakes – </i>Sustainably performing with stamina and consistency under intense pressure and pace</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Knowing Yourself – </i>Understanding and appreciating implications of leadership style amidst broadening power and influence</li>
</ul>
Whether conducted internally or in collaboration with an external partner, an assessment should be based on multiple sources of data. In terms of possible options, 360-degree feedback tools, simulations, structured interviews, and psychometric instruments can illuminate the extent to which a leader demonstrates each of the capabilities described above. We find it helpful to quantify a leader’s readiness for scale through a series of numerical ratings. Specifically, we integrate each of our assessment inputs to assign a 1–5 rating for each of the nine capability areas. A rating of 4 signifies that a leader is ready to take on additional scale. A rating of 5 means that a leader is truly exceptional in a given area. Ratings of 3, 2, and 1 indicate gaps in readiness of varying degrees. By employing a similar approach, organizations can more effectively pinpoint development needs at the individual level. Numerical ratings also support advanced analytics that speak more broadly to strengths and gaps in the leadership pipeline as a whole. As an example, when reviewing scores in the aggregate, one client discovered that many of its leaders had a penchant for execution that came at the expense of innovation and long-term planning.

&nbsp;
<h3>Specify the knowledge and experiences that are needed</h3>
&nbsp;

As with essential capabilities, organizations need to be precise in assessing leaders against the specific knowledge and experiences required for a given role. Doing so is critical both to evaluating a candidate’s viability as a possible successor and to matching leaders with development opportunities that allow them to move up the learning curve more rapidly. One of our clients needed to strengthen its pipeline of general managers. As with many organizations, the GM role was a linchpin in creating value for the company. To identify the knowledge and experiences required for the role, the organization conducted interviews with a number of its former and incumbent GMs. The interviews generated a comprehensive list of knowledge and experiences that included the following:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Has been fully accountable for a P&amp;L</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Has led a significant reorganization in excess of $10 million</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Worked as an expat in multiple markets</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Has been the lead in building strategy for a new business or product</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Led a successful enterprise-wide transformation from beginning to end</li>
</ul>
A survey was used to determine a leader’s level of expertise in each of the areas identified as being critical to success in a GM role. The survey was completed by the leaders themselves along with their managers. The resulting output was then incorporated into talent roundtable discussions, and decisions became more data-based as a result.

&nbsp;
<h3>Additional variables</h3>
&nbsp;

A number of additional variables should be accounted for in the succession planning process.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Performance Ratings – Even though many organizations overindex on performance ratings in assessing potential, it is still informative to review a leader’s track record of success in current and prior roles.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Engagement Survey Data – Unfortunately, engagement survey results often cannot be tied back to a specific leader. When they can, however, the results provide useful data across a number of areas, including a leader’s ability to motivate and bring out the best in others.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Mobility – Many leaders are unwilling to work in certain parts of the world. By collecting data on mobility, organizations can ensure that a leader is willing to relocate to a particular geography in determining their viability as a successor.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Retention Risk – Though difficult to assess objectively, retention risk also should be considered as part of the succession planning process. As a best practice, managers and HR business partners should be checking in regularly with key talent regarding their aspirations and level of satisfaction with the organization. Compensation data also can be reviewed to help determine the likelihood that a leader might seek out greener pastures. Surprising departures of key talent cannot be eliminated entirely. However, by evaluating retention risk and then taking action where appropriate, organizations can help ensure that viable successors remain with the organization for the long term.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Releasability – When a critical role is vacated, companies sometimes discover that the next-in-line successor cannot be released from their current position to fill the void. By incorporating data on releasability into the succession planning process, organizations can proactively identify areas of risk and then create contingency plans as needed.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Diversity &amp; Inclusion Data – It is absolutely vital for a company’s talent pipeline to be diverse. Therefore, organizations need to consider ethnicity, gender, and other relevant variables as part of succession management. Doing so can identify underrepresented groups, and corrective actions can then be taken.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3>Analytics</h3>
&nbsp;

Many companies have underdeveloped analytics capabilities with respect to succession management. As a result, key questions can only be answered through a manual, arduous, and time-consuming process. In contrast, a number of best-in-class organizations have developed web-based analytics tools that allow key questions to be answered at the push of a button. Regardless of the specific tool and approach a company elects to use, it should organize its succession management data such that questions like the following can be easily explored.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">For what percentage of our enterprise-critical roles do we have at least two “ready now” successors?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Are there key talent segments (e.g., general managers) for which the succession pipeline is deficient?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">How often are we able to fill open enterprise-critical roles with internal, rather than external, candidates?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">How many leaders are currently listed as potential successors for multiple roles?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">How diverse is the talent pipeline? Which groups, if any, are underrepresented?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Which leadership capabilities (e.g., Leading the Future) are underdeveloped across the pipeline?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What is the average tenure in role of leaders in the succession pipeline?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What is the rate of attrition among leaders who have been identified as viable successors for key roles? How does this rate compare to that of employees in the company as a whole?</li>
</ul>
Companies can create a real source of competitive advantage by consistently making the right succession management decisions. To do so, many organizations have no choice but to replace their “ornaments” with an evidence-based approach that fully leverages data and analytics.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is predicting and developing 21st century talent. As always, should you or any of your team fail, the C-suite will disavow any knowledge of your actions. This article will self-destruct in two minutes.

So, you take on the mission. Driving this course is not going to be easy. It will involve making turns at speed, accelerating fast, and at times stopping dead in your tracks. All without the wheels falling off.

&nbsp;
<h3>Succession planning is a fluid and dynamic state</h3>
&nbsp;

Succession planning in the 21st century operates in a fluid and dynamic context. For nearly all of our clients, their worlds are interdependent. What happens in Hong Kong today impacts what happens in Brussels or London tomorrow. Leaders are increasingly operating in a highly interconnected world—where certainty and predictability are rare. Our research of what good 21st century leadership looks like at the individual level unearths some core characteristics. To begin, we have to look at the person in composite –. that is, their whole self from cognitive to emotional and from well-being to energy. The whole self becomes increasingly important as the leadership bar continues to rise. For example, it is one thing to be able to think in an interdependent way. It’s another to remain focused and calm handling the volume and at times competing nature of information, plus subsequently creating compelling messages that galvanize people to action!

&nbsp;
<h3>Finding 21st century talent can be hard - like looking for a polar bear in a snowstorm</h3>
&nbsp;

We need to add a touch more color of what we are to find, what we are looking for. What our research shows is that the best-of-the-best leaders are emotionally and intellectually agile. They are intensely aware of their surroundings, and at their core, they are psychologically stable and are authentic. Nice starting list, I hear you say. “But how easy it is to spot perfection?” True, it’s hard to find what you’re looking for in a blizzard of ‘potential’ indicators. We need a framework and model to support our quest for the holy grail of leadership. A robust prediction for 21st talent needs to be based on research and data.

Our model—a leader’s Readiness for Scale℠ model—is geared to exactly what it takes to lead in roles with increased complexity and size. To scale effectively, a leader needs to be able to think systemically. Moreover, a leader needs to think broadly in more complicated environments and have the confidence to make trade-off decisions. We are looking for leaders who stay focused on the actions that will move things forward today, while putting out sensors in the environment to read the signs (obvious and not) to adapt when necessary and maintain momentum for the longer term. Leaders need to collaborate across borders, open mindedly, and see differences of opinions as opportunities. Moreover, they show up as their ‘best self’— every day.

So, good news, with a model to leverage, you’re well on the way to finding the right people—those select few who show the signs they can operate at scale. Mission part one accomplished. Our <a href="http://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/succession-planning-21st-century-talent-part-2">next blog post</a> will look at the “now what”? How do you retain and develop these 21st century models of talent?

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Years ago, I shared an early draft of a competency model with a Japanese colleague. He responded, “Where is humility on this model? If you have humility, you include customer service, quality, etc.” I replied that customer service and quality were already represented on the model, but that when you norm a model on American executives, humility doesn’t necessarily jump to the top of the list. This remains too true today.

Cultural differences may account for some, but not all of the differences in these perspectives. Indeed, Japanese culture encourages selflessness and group decision making, and American culture celebrates independent thinkers and individual achievement.  In the U.S., promotions and pay are often given to top producers, not great managers. Many of the leaders that we celebrate built their empires on the backs of their workers, e.g., the industrialists of the early 20th century.

Humility is a highly desirable and infrequently observed quality in leaders. Leaders are most effective when they view themselves as working in service to their teams. By providing clarity of purpose, removing obstacles and providing resources and coaching to their direct reports, managers help increase employee engagement and drive achievement. Knowing when to get out of the way is one of the most effective things that leaders can do to empower their teams.

There are some situations where heroic, ego-driven leadership is indicated. During a crisis, people look for decisive, single-minded leaders who are crystal clear on what they expect to happen next. Employees certainly appreciate leaders who don’t ask them to do what they are unwilling to do themselves, e.g., working late night or on weekends. However, if this me-first characteristic is overdone, leaders will take the opportunities to learn and develop out of the hands of their direct reports and solve the situation themselves. In order to build organizational capability, it is preferable to leave the solutions to the people who are closest to the work and coach them towards improved performance.

Learning to be in service to the whole is one of the most difficult transitions for leaders to make.  Managers are often promoted for their individual effectiveness, but as they step up to larger leadership challenges, they will find themselves unable to scale their leadership if they stay too involved in the details. The ability to step away from micromanagement and trust their teams is a good demonstration of humility in action. Said another way, the skills that got them here are not the skills that will take them forward. Demonstrating humility builds trust and inspires followership for executives, providing them with the bandwidth to engage in more strategic pursuits.

Expressing gratitude for the platform that one is given is fundamental to demonstrating humility. Too often, executives are eager to attribute success to their own individual efforts and fail to credit the organizational resources that support their achievement, particularly around bonus negotiation time. More humble leaders recognize that they are most effective in the context of their organizations and that they need to be selfless in supporting the company that has enabled their success.

Some practical suggestions for demonstrating humility and gratitude:

<b>Take stock:</b> Reflect on the experiences and personal characteristics that have brought you to this point in your life. Parse out those things that are unique to you and those that you have been given. Make a list of those people and events that have supported your growth and achievement. Hint: It’s a long list.

<b>Give thanks:</b> It’s a small action that goes a long way. Thanking those around you who are integral to your success recognizes their contribution and inspires their partnership. Too often, people never know the impact that they have had on your life. Telling them what they did and how it was helpful to you will inspire optimism and engagement on their part.

<b>Give back:</b> To whom much has been given, much is expected. One of the best ways to honor your mentors and colleagues is to devote your efforts to developing the leadership of the future, whether that be in your community or place of work. In the end, the talent that you enable and inspire represents your legacy.

<b>Stay grounded:</b> Be realistic about your contributions and your limitations. Ask for feedback not just about what you have done well, but how you might improve. Set personal goals for your ongoing development and growth.

What goes around, comes around. The ability to demonstrate humility and show gratitude is certain to be returned in spades. Recognizing where your contribution ends and celebrating the contributions of others is fundamental to your ongoing growth and success as a leader. Good luck!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For more than sixty years, the primary resource for companies seeking outside executive talent to fill key roles has been search firms. The search firm business model has been remarkably resistant to change, with both retained and contingency searches costing as much as a third of first year compensation for the hired executive. While these firms offer a valuable service to their clients, there are some significant drawbacks to traditional search beyond the extraordinary fees.

Perhaps foremost is the fact that search firms cannot source candidates from their existing client base. This “off-limits” restriction reduces the candidate pool that companies seeking the best talent can get access to and consider. In addition, many search firms have added an assessment component to their client offerings. While the assessment staff inside search firms are often very capable professionals, many of my clients have expressed reservations about the independence and objectivity of assessments performed by search firms where the financial incentives to place candidates they are proposing are so great.

In the past year, I was introduced to a highly seasoned search professional who has built a remarkable platform for sourcing board and C-level talent. Ken Taylor was the head of the North American board and CEO practice at one of the largest search firms. A few years ago, Ken and his team began building a search engine drawing upon Standard and Poor's global database of more than two million corporate directors and candidates. The chief architect of the platform was KarenAnn Terrell, the former chief information officer of Walmart and the current chief digital and technology officer of GlaxoSmithKline.

The platform is now market ready and gives subscribers the ability to identify potential candidates for key positions <i>without any off-limits restrictions</i> and for a fraction of the cost of a traditional search—and it is updated nightly. The platform is named Director Search (<a href="http://www.directorsearch.com/">www.directorsearch.com</a>) as it was initially designed to source board candidates. I believe that Director Search has the potential to disrupt the legacy search industry.

If you are interested in accessing the full candidate pool for board members and executive level positions, you owe it to your company and stakeholders to learn more about Director Search. My colleagues at RHR International and I are so bullish about this platform that we have formed a partnership with Director Search and are recommending it to our clients. Through our partnership, subscribers to the platform can leverage RHR’s more than 70 years of experience in assessing and integrating executive talent to ensure the right selection decision is made and that the hired executive gets integration support to hit the ground running.

There are a number of useful features and functions to the Director Search platform, which Ken Taylor will be happy to demonstrate upon request. It is truly remarkable, and I encourage anyone looking to source board or executive talent from outside your company to explore this breakthrough service.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When the countdown to the new fiscal year begins, companies take a hard look at next year’s spend and carefully allocate resources to people development.

They identify gaps in the talent pipeline and carefully consider possibilities, and before you know it, they have focused their attention and investment on the high-potential (HiPo) talent.

Sound familiar? Absolutely!

Sound good? Not necessarily — and here’s why.

Investment in talent is essential, and many companies believe resources invested in high-potential employees will deliver the best possible return by readying future leaders. However, that assumption is potentially flawed as it doesn’t define the <i>impact</i> required of the talent investment or link it to the company’s strategy.

High-potential talent has become a catch-all expression that’s most typically associated with broad personality characteristics such as drive, self-awareness, and the ability to learn and be agile. Although these traits are important, they don’t necessarily relate to an employee’s ability to truly impact the performance of the business.

Investing in high-potential talent without carefully identifying and assessing employees who drive growth is akin to a CEO telling analysts the company’s two percent operating-margin improvement is due to an investment in and a deep commitment to high-grade pixie dust!

As an alternative, companies should consider the pivotal talent concept first put forward by authors and HR experts <a href="https://www.strimgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Boudreau_Ramstad_Beyond_HR_article2.pdf">Peter M. Ramstad and Dr. John W. Boudreau</a>. They believe companies should embrace a systematic, analytical framework in their decision making and devote their resources to the employees pivotal to the company’s success.

To put it in perspective, the employees who can best drive specific results are essentially human levers with the power to produce significant outcomes with relatively minor behavioural shifts.

That’s exactly why companies should consider a different approach:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">First, zero in on company strategies and key goals.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Then and only then identify the pivotal talent pools and individuals who would most impact the strategic objectives. This should form the basis of the talent-planning process and investment in development.</li>
</ul>
We recently worked with a manufacturer whose leaders knew they had to look for different ways to maximize the top line in an increasingly competitive, finite market. Strategically, they had to grow their service business (which was higher margin and longer term) rather than simply sell more of a product that was likely to be purchased only once in a limited market.

Instead of recommending the blanket HiPo development route, RHR International collaborated with the manufacturer to fully understand its strategy and then determine which talent pools had the most impact on selling service contracts. It turns out the service engineers, who visited the sites regularly and had formed close relationships with the users, were most likely to influence sales. Of all the manufacturer’s employees, the service engineers had the most consistent—and relevant—contact with customers.

As a result, development resources were allocated to the service engineers, who were encouraged to spend more—not less—time with their long-term, repeat customers to further entrench the relationships. They were introduced to the service-selling concept and learned how to talk to the customer about what the customer does every day and about how a well-maintained product delivers quantifiable business benefits.

Because management fully supported them, and they finally had the time and communication skills, they were able to ask the questions that truly mattered to the manufacturer’s <i>and</i> the product users’ service and maintenance departments: “How do you use the product? What issues have you had with it? What could it do better? Do you have a busy and a slow season? Should we adjust our visits accordingly?”

This manufacturer successfully embedded the pivotal talent concept across its day-to-day operations to deliver measurable top- and bottom-line results.

The best practices that worked so well for this manufacturer make sense for all goal-oriented companies that want to demonstrate measurable ROI for their talent-development budget.
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Understand your company’s strategy</b>, ask questions about the human levers who will most impact performance, and focus on the talent pools that will achieve those results. This approach and perspective are outside the comfort zone of some HR leaders, but in today’s competitive business environment, they can give you and your company an edge.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Shift the focus to the pivotal talent</b> who will have the most impact on your company’s performance. Asking a simple question such as, “Who is the company’s pivotal talent?” may produce some interesting results. Be prepared for generic answers such as, “our managing directors and HiPos,” as this shows that leaders haven’t linked their view of talent to the organization’s goals and strategies.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Recognize the limitations of the high-potential label.</b> Investment in long-term development is necessary, but the HiPo label raises the question, “High potential for what?” Consider using more precise language, such as “talent ready to scale their leadership” or “talent pivotal to the growth of service contracts.” Also, remember that labelling someone a HiPo invariably means creating more PoPos (pissed off and passed overs), which does both your company and its employees a massive disservice.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Validate the talent independently of manager recommendations</b>. That’s because managers are often inherently biased and tend to select employees much like themselves. They also focus more on their direct reports’ current performance than their ability to help the company reach strategic success.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Define and measure the impact of talent interventions on organisational performance.</b> In my experience, HR departments rarely use impact measures to define their success and focus instead on the number of people in their succession pools or satisfaction ratings for development programmes.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Systematically collect and leverage data that demonstrates the impact of your company’s talent investments. </b>It’s surprising how little impact data is collected, because it can inform HR’s decision making and justify its strategies. It is also surprising how much of the HR data about talent rests in unwieldy spreadsheets or individual reports.</li>
</ol>
All talent deserves the right to be developed, and it should form part of the employee value proposition. But not all talent is pivotal, and companies and HR departments would benefit from investing more time targeting this group and showing clearer links between their talent interventions and the strategic performance of the business.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Designed to help CEOs and senior executives grow in their leadership, this occasional series offers insights on leadership seldom seen in textbooks. This is the second of a two-part interview. </i><a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/client-perspective-ceo-ravi-saligram-of-ritchie-bros-auctioneers/"><i>Read part 1 here.</i></a>

<b>David: There is a sharp increase in public companies in the U.S. separating the role of chairperson and CEO, as is the standard in Europe. Do you favor one approach over the other? What are your insights into optimal board/CEO dynamics when the role of chairperson and CEO is separated?</b>

<b>Ravi:</b> I've been on an incredible board at Church &amp; Dwight, and to me it's a shining example of a great board with amazing board members. It's also an extremely well-run company, and the market cap has gone from $2 billion to over $14 billion in 12 years. Sometimes I feel that at Church &amp; Dwight, being a board member is like being a Maytag repairman—you keep waiting for the call for help, but it never comes.

Speaking for myself and not for other board members, I feel the Church &amp; Dwight board really has a very good understanding of the role of the board versus the role of management. Jim Craigie is a terrific chairman and CEO who led the company from 2007–2016; in the last two years, it's been Matt Ferrell, who used to be the CFO and is now carrying on the legacy.

We brought RHR in once to do a project on a board and CEO alignment. That was an inflection point where the board really focused on being strategic and letting management manage. The board must understand very clearly its role and, unless the business is going to hell in a handbasket, not interfere and micromanage.

On the flip side, I've also been on boards that have been quite dysfunctional. Boards have to recognize that it is the CEO and management who really drive shareholder value. It's important for the board to ask, “Do we have the right team, do we have the right strategy, et cetera?” but not try to run the business. The board’s role is to create the right environment for success.

With dysfunctional boards, you've got to question, "Does the board really understand its role? And is the composition of the board right?" And then you get to the issue of chairman and CEO. When you're a rookie CEO, it is good to have a non-executive chairman because the CEO needs to learn the ropes and learn to run the company. In some companies it makes sense to separate the roles. In some companies it doesn't.

Where it becomes a problem is if the non-executive chairman really wants to be executive chairman and run the company, and this person wants the CEO to be more like a COO or do the bidding of the chairman.

At Ritchie Bros., I have an excellent relationship with our non-executive chairman because she and I are very good at respecting each other's roles. I know that her job is to manage the board. My job is to run the company. But our jobs are hinged on each other. Communication becomes very important. I speak with her every two weeks. Because we talk a lot, she's never surprised. Ultimately, she and I are completely aligned on the vision for the company, and there is great chemistry and complementarity. I am passionate and emotional, while she is calm and even-keeled. She makes a great sounding board.

But the CEO communicating with the chairman is not enough. It’s also important to have ongoing communication with individual board members because they're all independent, and they bring different perspectives.

It has to be in the right spirit of communication and not politicking. You don't want to create cliques and division in the board, so you must make sure the board is aligned. Your job as CEO is to make sure there is constant communication and alignment.

The last thing is that management sometimes gets frustrated, saying, “If we talked about it at the previous meeting, you should remember." Board members sit on lots of boards. They come once a quarter. They don't remember everything.

It's important that you keep that cadence of communication and think through what you want the board to take away. Always put yourself in their shoes and ask yourself, “What are they trying to achieve?” If you view things through that lens, you can tailor your communications to make sure the board can do its job.

<b>David: You are very close to your immediate and extended family. How do you ensure you are bringing your best self to both work and family?</b>

<b>Ravi:</b> My wife works harder than I do. Without her, I wouldn’t have been able to achieve all that I have, including moving to different countries and changing jobs. She is the eternal optimist and lifts my spirits.

We are two A-plus-type personalities, and it's trickled down to our daughters as well. In our house, all of us believe that work comes first. If one of our daughters says, "I've got to go to this meeting, and I can't make a family outing," we say, "We absolutely understand." It's just in our DNA.

My daughters are 30 and 29, and we typically do all our vacations together. When we are together, we talk about our lives. My girls and my wife are also great sounding boards for me. And having two amazing daughters and a smart wife has shaped a lot of my views and my quest to address gender diversity in companies.

But while my family and I are in sync with regard to work and life, it can take time for my teams to adapt. They all know that the boss practices what he preaches. Having said that, it is a little unnerving for them when they get an email at 2:00 a.m. I don't expect people to reply to me at 2:00 a.m., but not everyone understands.

I put a lot of emphasis on caring for people, especially if I know they work hard and do their best. On the other hand, if I feel some of my direct reports or people below are slackers and don't work hard, they don't do well with me.

I'm respectful about work/life balance for others, but at senior executive levels, I feel it has to be a proper balance. It can’t be all about life and very little about work. I expect my senior executives to be role models, to be highly committed and passionate, and be truly all-in.

At the end of the day for me, my family comes first. It’s not just my daughters and my wife—my brother is also an important person in my life. He is one of my very best friends and my confidant. He just got promoted to be the chief operating officer of a public company. We are two Indian immigrants, 16 years apart, living the American dream!

I also have a close bond with my sister who lives in India. She has a zest for life and is the most affectionate person I know. She is very important, as are my nieces and nephews, my aunts, my uncles, and my cousins, so there's a huge extended family. I feel very happy and alive because I don't at all look at myself as a unidimensional person for whom it's all about work. Work enables me to do my other pursuits and at the same time engages me on many levels: intellectually, emotionally, and even at a deeper level, since I love building sustainable, thriving organizations.  In many ways, I’m very lucky to have such professional and personal fulfillment.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s human nature for leaders to compare themselves to others—including those on their team(s) who report to them—to assess how similar or different their own skills, abilities, beliefs, or attitudes are. We wanted to take this line of thinking one step further to uncover how these similarities and differences play out in organizations and impact leadership.

Research continues to show the numerous positive outcomes associated with more diverse teams, including better decision-making effectiveness and innovation. The leader’s role in this is also critical: leaders of higher-performing teams intentionally seek out different perspectives, ways of thinking, and approaches, according to our own research and experience.

But are there exceptions to this? In a world where diverse and inclusive leadership take the crown (and we agree), are there one or two personality characteristics, values, or behaviors that, when shared among team members and leaders, are beneficial to the leader’s effectiveness and team performance overall?

To gain insight into this question, we analyzed data from 29 leadership teams1, including input from team members’ and leaders’ personality and values assessments (across 28 different scales), as well as each team’s responses to RHR’s Senior Team Effectiveness Survey. While our prior research on top teams has identified several leader behaviors as key drivers of team performance, for this research, we focused on the team’s view of the leader’s effectiveness specifically.

The majority of our results show that the more effective the leaders, the more likely it is that they are leading teams composed of individuals with personality and values profiles dissimilar from their own. There were only a couple of exceptions to this. We’ve narrowed our focus to go in-depth on one of these findings to help elucidate what a leader can do to be aware of these characteristics, and subsequently, how they can think differently about the implications of these personality similarities, particularly in times of stress.

Adjustment, or the degree to which a person is calm and resilient (higher “Adjustment”) or moody and volatile (lower Adjustment), was one of these personality characteristics where similarity matters. We found that the greater the proportion of individuals in a team who had <b>similar Adjustment scores to their leader</b> (at either the high or low end), the greater the team rated their leader’s ability <b>to energize and inspire</b> team members. In other words, inspiring and energizing leaders tend to lead teams with an Adjustment profile similar to their own.

Digging deeper into both sides of the Adjustment scale, it starts to make sense as to why team members with scores on either end of the adjustment continuum would find a similar leader more energizing. We hypothesize that this scale could be rather polarizing because of the stress-management aspect. For instance, a direct report who is more sensitive and reactive (lower Adjustment score) might be put off if their higher Adjustment score leader is unphased by the current level of stress. This direct report may better connect with a leader’s realistic acknowledgement of the current state of affairs and understanding from their leader of the pressure being faced, rather than the sunny, optimistic, “everything is going to be fine,” attitude they are receiving. In these situations, individuals want to feel that their experience of stress is validated, but they may not be receiving the empathy and social support from their leader that they need.

Conversely, a direct report who is more resilient and steadfast (higher Adjustment score) may be less motivated by a leader who is more critical or often becomes flustered in tense situations (lower Adjustment score). In this case, the direct report may not always appreciate the unabashed realism of their leader, and instead would be more motivated by a leader who is patient, remains optimistic in the face of adversity, and more easily bounces back from setbacks.

So, what do you do as a high Adjustment score leader hoping to motivate or inspire a predominantly low Adjustment score team (or vice versa)? Studies show that our personality remains relatively stable over time, so the ask is not for leaders to <i>change</i> their personality, but to instead be more aware of how their current behaviors or approaches can impact their effectiveness. <b>The more the leader knows the team and understands how each individual </b><b><i>responds</i></b><b> to stress (be it similar or different from their own approach), the more equipped the leader will be to adjust accordingly, and appreciate the benefits of both perspectives in helping the team attain its goals. </b>

For each team, we calculated the percent of team members who were similar to their leader across each of the 28 different personality and value assessment scores. We then examined the relationship between leader-team similarity and ratings of leader effectiveness.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Building or transforming a company is one of the most difficult tasks a leader can take on. It requires vision, courage, discipline, business smarts, and the capacity to build followership. It also takes tremendous energy and resilience. <i>You have landed your dream job—the question now is whether you are up for it.</i>

Consider two different leaders: Both were new CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. Both had track records of success in their previous company. Both entered the role with strong vision, resources, and support from the board. They also inherited equally challenging scenarios including cultures that refused to change and an industry that was rapidly outpacing them—yet one failed and one succeeded. Why?

A closer look reveals that the success of one and the failure of the other were not related to technical skill and knowledge. The determining factor was the ability to maintain conviction and focus in the face of adversity. The successful CEO had a clear vision for the company that superseded the pressure for short-term gain. She also had the ability to confront hard realities and the requisite energy to persist when times were tough. The other CEO started with a strong vision and a great strategy but did not have the conviction to follow through. The more external stress increased, the more indecisive and isolated he became. Most new CEOs assume that if they have been successful in previous jobs, they will be successful in this new role. But the truth is that this next level of leadership comes with a degree of stress and adversity unlike anything they have encountered previously.

One way to ensure that you are prepared for a top job is to adopt some of the habits proven to enhance performance in elite athletes. Staying mentally and physically strong in adverse conditions is not a given. Any great athlete knows that you need to train your mind and your body for the most extreme conditions in order to be prepared for unexpected challenges. Jim Loehr and Jack Groppel, the founders of the Human Performance Institute, did decades of research on this exact phenomenon. They found that the ability to sustain high levels of performance in the toughest of times depends on three things:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Commitment to an ultimate purpose in life that is bigger than you</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">The ability to manage your mental, emotional, and physical energy</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Commitment to staring down the truth and adapting when necessary</li>
</ul>
Interestingly, we are seeing evidence that the same principles apply in the business realm, although I would probably add a fourth dimension to the above bullets: the ability to surround yourself with great people committed to the same mission and vision. Success in the top job is not a certainty. The tactics used at one level of performance do not always apply at the next. You have to evolve your purpose, your habits, and your coping strategies to ensure resilience and focus. Fortunately, others have been there before you and paved the way. There is a proven path, but it takes a willingness to objectively reexamine parts of your life and the ability to put truth into action. It’s not a journey for the faint of heart, but perhaps no well-lived life ever is.

		<title><![CDATA[CEO Succession: Four Tips to Ensuring Success]]></title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[CEO succession is not an event, but a series of actions orchestrated over the course of several years. The more one anticipates the nuances and implications of early actions and those that follow, the more successful the eventual selection and transition of the next CEO. Proactively expanding the focus of one’s lens throughout the process can reveal the more nuanced opportunities that might otherwise be overlooked. With this as a backdrop, here are four tips on how to make this go as successfully as possible.

<b>1) The board should engage early and often.  </b>

While the ultimate responsibility of choosing the next CEO falls to the board, ensuring the development of a pipeline of senior talent falls under the responsibility of the CEO and CHRO. When a CEO transition is assumed to be many years out, the CEO and CHRO tend to drive this process, sometimes with minimal attention from the board. However, early and consistent engagement by the board can help build and maintain alignment regarding where the organization is heading and the implications for the type of skillsets and experiences that will be required to lead in the future. Finding opportunities for board members to interact with the identified individuals over the course of time allows the directors to form (and update) their own views of the executives and their current development needs. Finally, individual directors can serve as mentors to these executives, accelerating their evolution.

<b>2) Focus on the entire C-suite as a constellation of roles to be filled. </b>

Viewing succession in terms of the overall ensemble versus individual roles yields multiple benefits. A new CEO will not be successful without a highly capable team surrounding him or her. And it is unlikely that whoever is selected as the next CEO will meet all of the desired attributes and skillsets. Ensuring that complementary skills and experience exist elsewhere on the team can help to mitigate some of the risks. Expanding the view to the senior team also creates opportunities to develop individuals in the broader pipeline as a cohort, particularly where there is a similar gap across the group. Finally, if the incumbent senior executives are in equivalent stages of their lives, it is possible that many if not most will also choose to leave around the same time. Anticipating when the C-suite executives are likely to retire allows the option to intervene and alter the sequence and pacing to minimize disruption to the organization.

<b>3) Leverage existing business issues within the organization. </b>

For high-level executives who have had a vertical career trajectory through an individual function or business unit, assigning roles that expose them to other parts of the business without also creating either a demotion or huge risk for the organization can be a challenge. However, particularly in larger organizations, there are generally key initiatives, events, and other issues requiring savvy leadership that may provide stretch experiences for these executives while also allowing them to prove their abilities to flex into new areas. This shift in perspective can highlight multiple creative options for developing key executives while also addressing the emerging needs of the company.

<b>4) Look at the whole person. </b>

Skills, experience, exposure, and a solid track record are critical components to consider. However, self-insight, character, and personal resilience can also dictate whether or not a future senior executive will be able to make a consistent impact over time. These elements are ones that need to (and can) be proactively developed; it is considerably more challenging to positively impact these areas if ignored until a problem emerges. Organizations that value and systematically incorporate all aspects into their development processes are more likely to yield senior executives who can sustain the level of energy, health, focus, and integrity necessary to withstand the inevitable challenges they will face.

A simple widening of the focus of the lens one uses in considering CEO succession can yield a richer, more seamless, and ultimately, more successful outcome. By expanding the view, options, resources, and early warning signals can “magically” appear, enabling boards, CEOs, and CHROs to ensure they ultimately have highly capable senior executives ready to step into the roles when needed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Most relationships begin with an exciting courtship followed by a honeymoon period. Then the hard work begins. We often hear the excitement in the voices of both private equity investors and their new management teams as they focus primarily on all the wonderful opportunities that lie ahead. The annoyances and frustrations tend to show up after six months or so—perhaps the business isn’t performing as anticipated and then the board and/or operating partners are closer to the nuts and bolts of the business than either they or the management team expected. Even if the business is performing, being “managed” by a new set of investors with often unspoken expectations about communication or preparation for board meetings can begin to sour relations.

Rather than “learning by bumping into things,” there are a handful of best practices that, if followed, can really set you up for success. Not surprisingly, it isn’t rocket science.
<h3>Clarity and Alignment</h3>
Having a direct and open conversation about work styles and expectations, ideally in the diligence process, can go a long way toward paving the path toward success. Topics should include the following with a review of points of alignment and difference between both parties:
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1">Business objectives—do you have a common view of what can be achieved within an agreed-upon timeline?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Paths to growth and how they will be resourced—are you all on the same page (truly) or not? What are the sticking points? Are they valid?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Ways of working—e.g., degree of oversight and type of involvement from the private equity sponsor; what support does the management team want versus need?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Expectations around transparency and communication—formal and informal—including preparation for board meetings, what gets reported on, and the level of detail that is really needed.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Change agenda—including how change will be sequenced within a given timeframe.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Including the right stakeholders in the discussion—are the people who need to be involved in the above discussions and agreements actually at the table and are they being heard?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Expectations should be made explicit, documented, and revisited. Without some semblance of formality around this process, it is easy to go sideways and for a management team to feel blindsided when their private equity sponsors have a very different view of the future and how the partnership with the management team is structured.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Urgency Versus Importance</h3>
Everyone generally hears the clock ticking in a private equity operating environment. The private equity sponsors have relatively few levers they can pull to make a difference (such as changing the CEO), and they want to use them as quickly as possible. After that, they will still want rapid change but have to work through the management team in order to get it. The complaint we hear from management teams is that their private equity sponsors are not adequately tapped into the complexity of some of the business changes that need to be undertaken and the amount of time needed to do things well. It is critical to differentiate between business requirements that are urgent and those that are merely important to ensure that speed is not injected just for the sake of it. Change takes time; if it is rushed, it generally doesn’t stick. For example, the integration of an acquisition can be a one- to two-year process. It is critical to get aligned on issues that can be fast tracked and those that need adequate attention to detail.
<h3>Test of Relationship</h3>
Often, the true test of the board and management team relationship is when the business hits some headwinds. We have seen knee-jerk reactions from some private equity boards, which can often result in diverting from the original plan. In these moments, it is important to maintain cohesion and to increase transparency. The result might be the need to reset expectations, but first a forensic analysis of the business problem is required to truly understand what is happening and how to manage out of it. If the management team has no clue how they ended up in the situation and have few ideas about how to get out of it, then changes are likely justified. Before getting to that point, it is important to hear their plan and guard against the creation of two groups—the private equity firm and the management team—getting frustrated with each other versus coming together to assess the problem.
<h3>Humility (on Both Sides)</h3>
The secret to a strong relationship is the pooling of mutual humility. Deal and operating partners can learn a lot from their management teams and vice-versa. The idea that “our private equity partners do things <i>to</i> us versus <i>with</i> us” is a sentiment we sometimes hear that causes angst and frustration. Getting clear on <i>where</i> and <i>when </i>board members/operating partners should and shouldn’t weigh in on business issues is important to tease out. And if the private equity firm is managing the business, it is clearly a problem that should be remedied quickly.
<h3>Open Communication and Feedback</h3>
It is amazing how far we all let issues advance before stating them or talking them through. Often, a small issue that could have been raised by the private equity firm with the management team gets glossed over. Then it grows, and having the corrective conversation becomes difficult. Setting up a norm around open feedback is strongly encouraged. It is important to expect that a new relationship will require some intestinal fortitude to set up the right way. Plan for it, push for it, and create the time and climate to make it happen proactively.
<h3>One Team</h3>
The bottom line is that if private equity firms and their management teams are working at cross-purposes, everyone fails. Getting aligned at the beginning of the relationship and continuing to have an open dialogue about what<i> is</i> and <i>is not </i>working is key to a healthy and productive setup.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the third and final part of our interview with Jim Barr, a C-level leader who has worked with iconic brands, including Ritchie Bros., an RHR client, as each struggled to adapt to changes in customer journeys. RHR Senior Partner David Astorino interviewed him. <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/jim-barr-digital-growth-transformation-leader-part-2">Read Part 2 here</a>.

<b>David: What are the leadership skills and capabilities necessary when driving major transformations?</b>

<b>Jim</b>: There are a number of them I want to highlight. Specifically:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Breaks glass every day—but the right amount and in a productive way.</i> It is important to move the needle but not go faster than the company is capable of, at least until the new capabilities can be developed.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Embodies the 3 P’s previously mentioned: be positive, be passionate in your belief, and be persistent</i>. Doing so, along with having high energy, really helps leaders drive meaningful change.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Loves to teach/learn from/develop others</i>. This is not unique to transformations, but having leaders like this is even more helpful as companies make big changes.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Focuses on what changes are necessary</i>. Listening to those with institutional knowledge, respecting the past, and deciphering what must change and what should remain and form the foundation for a new future is critical. A corollary to the glass-breaking comment is to recognize what makes a company great and to resist changing that too quickly.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Makes others better/shares credit.</i> Again, not unique to transformative cultures, but leaders who care about winning in a new paradigm don’t get caught up in receiving personal credit. There is no time for that.</li>
</ul>
<b>David: What characteristics have you seen in the best teams you have worked with?</b>

<b>Jim:</b> I’ve had the good fortune to work with many great senior teams. Here are some of the characteristics I have observed firsthand. The best teams do the following:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Balance believing in the vision with delivering results in the present.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Share a common desire to do something memorable and great and to win.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Have a realistic assessment of the situation and what needs to be done—they are not stuck in the past.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Bring a healthy debate and diversity of thought, which brings out the best solutions.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Believe in team over self and eliminate bias, parochial views, and reward systems. Balance is the challenge, and it is best to have teams and leaders who take the customer/company view versus a self-interested one.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">See that growth comes from getting outside one’s comfort zone. Good teams don’t seek to be comfortable; instead they let the customer, data, and insight constantly drive them.</li>
</ul>
I’ve been fortunate to work with some iconic brands and in very challenging transformations of companies and industries. Some were quite successful, but all provided valuable lessons. Hopefully, some of these learnings will help those who will be leaders of the many transformations to come.

<i>We’d like to thank Jim for taking the time to sit with us and talk in such depth.</i>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>This is the second part of our three-part interview with Jim Barr, a C-level leader who has worked with iconic brands, including Ritchie Bros., an RHR client, as each struggled to adapt to changes in customer journeys. RHR Senior Partner David Astorino interviewed him. </i><a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/jim-barr-digital-growth-transformation-leader"><i>Read Part 1 here</i></a><i>.</i>

<b>David: What are some important learnings leaders can use and some key steps they can take to drive their transformations?</b>

<b>Jim:</b> There is likely no single “right” recipe. Some version of these steps may be helpful for leaders to potentially adapt to their own situation. These steps may seem basic, but I’ve seen failures at each stage. They consist of making a case for change, creating a compelling vision, defining a simple strategy, aligning everything toward the strategy, and staying the course. Let me elaborate:
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Make a persuasive case for change.</i> The case usually incorporates some compelling data/insights you may even already have. It comes from studying how the customer journey (i.e., the purchase process) or value proposition is evolving and where it is likely going. At OfficeMax, we learned our core customer had evolved from the back-to-school mom to the small business owner who now wanted printing services and web hosting as much as she wanted pens and paper. The purchasing journey had also changed to include online search engines and product reviews more often than traditional TV and newspapers. We needed to align marketing spend and products around these changes. At Sears.com, Amazon was killing us with endless aisle assortment, so we went from 50,000 SKUs to over five million in less than two years (mostly through drop-ship arrangements). At Ritchie, we did a seller segmentation and found compelling data about our sellers’ behaviors that spurred us to launch new formats and got leaders, investors, and ultimately, the whole team on board. A second tactic is to address head-on what happens if you don’t change. Optimism leads us to believe we can stay mostly where we are. But it is important to depict an honest “hands off the wheel” or “glide path” scenario. What would really happen? The end picture often doesn’t look good, and the business case can help justify resourcing the transformation. Finally, the case for change must be evangelized and repeated. Do it past when many eyes begin to roll!</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Create a compelling vision</i>. Once a need to change is widely accepted, leaders must articulate <i>what</i> success should look like. One helpful tactic is painting a vision of the company three to five years out. It should articulate such things as how customers will interact with and view the company, how its brands will evolve and, of course, revenues and profits. This “true north” vision, once agreed on, becomes a beacon and helps drive decisions. Any major decision needs to move the needle toward true north.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Define a simple strategy</i>. After the team knows it needs to change and what success looks like, it is necessary to articulate the <i>how</i> (strategy) in an easy-to-understand way. What is the durable, multiyear roadmap toward the true north being sought? This is perhaps the most important step, and it is a challenge. It must move fast enough to get to the vision in the desired time. It must be simple enough to understand and for each associate to see where they fit in and what they should do differently. And it must be realistic and not ask the company to do something it cannot do (e.g., an industrial company becoming a digital company in six months). Typically, effective strategic plans have no more than four or five pillars that will likely persist for three to five years (though tactics under each pillar can be examined and tweaked periodically).</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Align everything toward the strategy</i>. This turns a good strategy into reality. All the key levers must be aligned to the vision and strategy. Key elements include resource allocation, business-model evolution, linking rewards (e.g., bonuses and sales compensation) to the new direction, and making sure the right people are in the right jobs (most often the organizational structure needs a refresh). If you do everything else but don’t marshal financial and people resources to the new direction, change will not happen at the desired speed.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Finally, be persistent and stay the course</i>. Leading previously successful companies in profound transformations to be successful in the next phase is super rewarding but not easy, and there will be many tough days. It takes a certain type of leader; it takes three P’s—be positive, be passionate in your belief, and be persistent. These will be needed to get your team through the challenges.</li>
</ol>
<b>David: What are some of the leadership challenges inherent when transforming traditional companies, business models, and brands?</b>

<b>Jim</b>: Every transformation is unique, but there are some common challenges. In addition to overcoming an overly narrow view of competition, a natural economic disincentive to disrupt the business, cultural challenges, and inertia, you need to maintain agility for the long run. I’ll explain:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>A stale and overly narrow view of competition. </i>Many fall prey to a narrow view of competition. As a personal example, in the mid-1990s, Britannica viewed its key competition as being another print encyclopedia, World Book, and believed its own core value proposition—being the most comprehensive (44 volumes, 40 million words) and authoritative (articles written by Nobel laureates)—still held. Unfortunately, it missed the fact that there were much cheaper substitutes that were “good enough,” including free versions bundled with PCs and, later, Wikipedia. I’ve seen some version of this at nearly every company: failing to keep examining the full array of <i>substitutes</i> for products and evolving customer needs.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>A natural economic disincentive to disrupt the business.</i> At the core of each company, particularly those that have been leaders, is the tendency to protect and maintain the core business instead of evolving and strengthening it. Implicit in this is fear that acceleration, adoption of new technologies, and addressing changes in customer journeys and value propositions will come—at least in part—at the expense of the core business. While intellectually rational, this notion is fueled by the illusion that the company has more control over customer choice and behavior than it really has. One form of the innovator’s dilemma is that companies with the most to lose delay bringing innovation to market; companies with less to lose are not bound by this. Kodak was an early leader in transitioning to digital photography but chose to manage the transition too slowly to capture the market, allowing others with less to lose beat them to digital storage, for example. They went from a potential disruptor to being disrupted. When I was at Microsoft in the late 90s and into the 00s, even though we were an otherwise innovative company with many smart people, we protected Windows and Office, leading us to hold back innovations we developed. Others didn’t hold back and capitalized on this. Examples include internet search (Google), tablets, and mobile phones (Apple). I’ve seen this theme repeated across companies and industries: you either lead the disruption or you become the disrupted.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Cultural challeng</i>es. Each company has a unique culture that has led them to be successful in the first place. However, often cultures are designed purposefully to be rigid so the company can persevere and stay on path. Ritchie had sold its services against all other ways to sell used construction equipment, so when its best customers began using online methods, the culture nonetheless initially rejected it and left key customer needs unaddressed.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Inertia</i>. Change is harder than doing the same comfortable thing, so it takes top-down leadership to make the case, which must be simple and repeated. It must come from the CEO and the board, and they must mean what they say (e.g., changes in resource allocation). Then it must ripple through all key aligning mechanisms, such as compensation. Long-held norms and learned behaviors are hard to break.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Maintaining agility for the long</i> <i>run. </i>Once a company has reacted successfully to transformation, it is important to keep the mindset of regularly re-examining its markets and customers and adjusting appropriately.</li>
</ul>
<i>In </i><a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/jim-barr-digital-growth-transformation-leader-part-3"><i>Part 3</i></a><i> of this interview, Jim describes the leadership skills and capabilities necessary when driving major transformations and the characteristics of a high-performing team.</i>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Jim Barr is a C-level leader who has worked with iconic brands as each struggled to adapt to changes in their customer journeys. In addition to driving digital transformations, Jim has been a general manager and president of several multi-billion-dollar online and omni-channel businesses. His experience includes over a decade as a leader in the internet division of Microsoft, two top-ten internet/omni-channel retailers, and three Fortune 500 companies.

Most recently, Jim was the group president of Ritchie Bros. (Ritchie), the world’s leading industrial auctioneer, where he teamed up with <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/about-rhr/our-work/ritchie-bros-auctioneers">CEO Ravi Saligram</a> to help transform the 60-year-old single-format used-heavy-equipment auctioneer into a global multichannel/digital leader in asset disposition and asset management.

Prior to that, he was chief digital officer of OfficeMax, where he launched online experiences, turned around the online division, and launched multichannel initiatives before it merged with Office Depot in 2013. Before OfficeMax, he was the first president of Sears Holdings’ newly formed Online Business Unit, driving key brands (such as Sears, Kmart, Craftsman, Kenmore, and DieHard) online.

Jim’s foundational digital executive experience came from launching several early-stage businesses at Microsoft’s online division (e.g., Shopping, Auctions, Yellow Pages, and Classifieds) as Microsoft balanced online growth with its traditional packaged-software business. Prior to that, he was at Encyclopædia Britannica, where the 250-year-old publisher and direct seller of encyclopedias and Merriam-Webster dictionaries was struggling to transition its products and business model to the coming internet age.

Jim earned an MBA in finance from the University of Chicago and an accounting degree from Miami University and was a CPA/auditor, management consultant, and investment banker. He is now working as a board member, consultant, and advisor. RHR has worked with Jim and his teams both at OfficeMax and Ritchie. Below is a series of questions posed by RHR Senior Partner David Astorino.

<b>David:</b> <b>You have spent 25 years in growth transformations. Do you have a favorite to highlight?</b>

<b>Jim:</b> My favorite is the most recent and, arguably, the most successful, Ritchie Bros., with <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/about-rhr/our-work/ritchie-bros-auctioneers">CEO Ravi Saligram.</a>

At Ritchie, we faced tremendous challenges—turning a largely analog company into an industry-leading digital-first company and transitioning from a single on-site auction model to one that includes more online formats—all while dealing with a substantial anti-online cultural bias. We ended up turning around existing online businesses and made investments in technology and people, ultimately offering a suite of on-site and online offerings that give customers full choice of how to buy and sell heavy equipment. We went from being purely an on-site physical auction company to the leader in several formats of buying/selling equipment, including online formats previously rejected by the culture of the company, and we even ventured into helping customers manage and finance their fleets outside the transaction.  A major accelerant was buying and integrating our largest online competitor. In the end, we accomplished in four years what we originally thought would likely take much longer. This illustrates that digital transformations can succeed even against significant internal and external challenges and in industries not known for their application of technology or for rapid change.

<b>David: When driving such large-scale transformations, what are some similarities and differences you have seen in different industries? How much is applicable across different companies and industries?</b>

<b>Jim:</b> Although all situations are unique, I would say 70–75% of transformations follow a common path and framework. A few things I’ve observed:

<i>The CEO always is a difference maker</i>. I don’t know of a successful transformation that wasn’t embraced by and driven first and foremost by the CEO. It’s not the digital person or someone with “transformation” in their title who makes it happen on their own. The CEO must garner support from investors and the board and then drive it through the executive team and to the rank and file. It takes some bold bets and some tough calls. It’s tricky to balance enhancing (read: not protecting) the core business with technology while recognizing current and future disruptive forces with innovating in adjacencies and setting the company up for a new future. It is not sacrificing the core for the exciting new but actively managing and balancing both optimally. I have been blessed with some strong and visionary CEOs, such as Ravi, in both OfficeMax and Ritchie.

<i>You need to swap out “C words.”</i> In nearly every situation, there is fear of cannibalization. It’s natural to think this way and some shift is unavoidable. Retail dot-coms have a different competitive set than their stores and some channel shift is inevitable. At OfficeMax, our online team matched Amazon’s price on printers even if it was below that of our physical retail stores. This initially ruffled some feathers—if we ran this lower price online, the prevailing logic was that customers would not come to the stores to buy this printer. The reality, of course, is that anyone who bothered to do a Google search, as was typical, would not have gone to our stores but rather purchased from Amazon. By matching price, we had a fighting chance to get the sale and capture the customer for the future. It also kept our brand relevant. Ultimately, many retailers, like Best Buy, moved toward matching all online prices at the stores as their new brand proposition. Instead of fearing some inevitable cannibalization, the more progressive thinkers create great experiences in both stores and online, mutually reinforcing the brand value and giving way to a new, heathier C word: choice. There is plenty of evidence now that the more ways a customer can interact with a brand successfully, the more relevant the brand will be.

<i>There is almost always a bit of a talent gap at the beginning of each transformation.</i> The future is inherently different from the past, so different skills are needed in some areas such as customer data/insights/business intelligence and digital/technology. It takes time to re-tool and get the right leaders and associates.

<i>There is a difference across industries in how advanced the digital transformations are.</i> Retail started earlier than most because disruptions are now decades old—whether it be Amazon, complete price transparency, the use of search to replace a traditional customer journey, etc. With sophisticated marketing capabilities, a robust email list, and even strong personalization, retail might be in the seventh inning of a nine-inning game. Other industries are well back in the second or third inning relative to where things will eventually go. Examples include healthcare, industrial companies (where Ritchie Bros. started), financial services, and lagging retail categories such as grocery.

<i>In </i><a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/jim-barr-digital-growth-transformation-leader-part-2"><i>Part 2</i></a><i> of this interview, Jim discusses steps leaders can take to drive company transformations and the inherent leadership challenges that come with transforming traditional companies, business models, and brands.</i>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/venture-capital-funnel-2/">According to CB Insights,</a> only 48% of seed-funded companies will raise another round. If a company secures more investment dollars, there is still no guarantee it will survive. What is happening? Contrary to popular opinion, it is often the fallibility of the founding team (and <i>not </i>the weakness of the original idea) that wreaks the most havoc. Here are four warning signs that you and your co-founders could be in trouble.
<ol>
 	<li>
<h3>Failure to Resolve Key Differences of Opinion</h3>
</li>
</ol>
While it is not unusual for co-founders to have different ideas on critical topics such as the go-to-market plan or the product vision, it is not a good sign when they fail to resolve those differences. Rather than leveraging differences of opinion to get to the best outcome, the founders butt heads, and a war of egos and personalities begins. Too much energy in the company goes to navigating unresolved conflict, and little goes to productivity. By the time the issues surface, time and money have been wasted, and emotional damage has severed bonds that were once aligned and optimistic.

<i>Key Question: Are you creating a team of builders working toward the same vision? If not, stop, take time to align, and have the tough conversations.</i>
<ol start="2">
 	<li>
<h3>Lack of Focus on Key Milestones</h3>
</li>
</ol>
There is an axiom that states, “where your attention goes, energy flows.” With limited time and resources, it is critical that the founding team stay focused on the actions that will achieve major milestones. I remember one of the first founder-CEOs I met who was spinning off the rails. His team kept asking how he was going to define success three months from now. He kept talking about grandiose visions and everything he was going to accomplish. In the meantime, the team did their best to produce something, but it was misdirected. Lots of good intentions with poor planning and failure to execute often leads to an inability to complete your central task (which is to prove product/market fit). Establishing focus, working toward milestones, and adapting along the way are skills critical to success.

<i>Key Question: How do you define value? If you can’t define it, you won’t produce it.</i>
<ol start="3">
 	<li>
<h3>Failure to Adapt</h3>
</li>
</ol>
One of the hardest executive skills to learn is determining when to stay the course and when to pivot. When you are in an early-stage company, there will be a lot of adaptation and learning as you go. As a founding team, you should assume one thing: whatever you envisioned originally will change. Something will go wrong—the consumer will react in an unexpected way, or there will be a fatal flaw in your design. The reality is that missteps are expected and are a key element of sprinting and moving fast. Founders who stubbornly adhere to one way of doing things when every data point indicates otherwise are doomed to fail. This does <i>not</i> mean giving up your vision. It <i>does </i>mean that building a company is iterative. Like playing a video game, you learn as you go: learn, adapt, and move on.

<i>Key Question: What is the market and the data telling you? What are you failing to observe?</i>
<ol start="4">
 	<li>
<h3>Trusting the Wrong People</h3>
</li>
</ol>
One other unfortunate truth in Silicon Valley is that not everyone has the best of intentions. There are frauds who speak the language and dress the part but who have actually never produced anything. The most benign people in this category are the <i>wannapreneurs, </i>those who want fame by association but don’t truly bring useful skills to the table. On the dark side, there are serial CEOs, CROs, CMOs, etc. who prey on the newbies who have good ideas. They jump from gig to gig and claim all sorts of success that they never really created. These folks can be hard to suss out because they talk a good game, but soon after you partner with them they create more spin than value. Nothing is delivered, yet their ego gets bigger, and they keep claiming success. Eventually, their energy is so toxic that the rest of the founders pick up on it, but it then takes massive energy to move them out and start over. By then, they have moved on to the next target.

<i>Key Question: Do you feel misled or manipulated? If so, something is off in the founder dynamic or with your first key hire. Don’t let it linger.</i>

As you build your company, remember that people matter. New companies begin as great ideas, but it is people who bring them to life. The myth of the self-absorbed genius founder is overhyped. Many of those leaders excel in spite of their personality, not because of it. Stay committed to your vision, but make sure you find the right partners. Cultivate honesty and transparency, stay focused on what matters, manage your time wisely, and pivot when necessary.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I love to use analogies in my work, and I share with executives frequently that taking them out of their own world helps them connect to the idea of feedback in both emotional and intellectual ways, making the learning more concrete. Much of my own insights about life and leadership often come from unlikely sources and rarely from a leadership book. One of my favorite sources is my special-needs daughter.

Neena was born with a very rare and complex genetic disorder that has resulted in multiple disabilities and significant delays across all development areas. I have often said that she has helped me understand things that would have been impossible for me to learn had she not blessed me as her mother. Part of Neena’s disabilities include a set of structural, behavioral, and medical complications that made it impossible for her to eat; as a result, Neena has been on a feeding tube for her entire life. When she was somewhere around 10 years old, we had given up and decided that the tube would always be there. In fact, perhaps we didn’t want her to eat. We could control her diet this way and keep her healthy. So there she stayed, making no progress.

Neena adopted this narrative, and it became her truth and her story until someone new came into her life who saw her potential and possibility. Today, Neena tries every food we put in front of her, enthusiastically and with the greatest of joy. I have finally experienced cooking for her and feeding her in the way we often imagine nourishing our children. I would like to tell you that it was my amazing abilities to inspire my child that created this breakthrough, but it was and has been Neena’s persistence to defy what anyone thinks of her that keeps her moving forward. Additionally, it was her new support system with fresh eyes and a belief in her potential that created a new story that Neena could believe in.

You may say, “This is a very lovely story, but what does it have to do with leadership?” The reality is that as leaders we make decisions like this about our people all of the time. We decide what they can or can’t do, and we are constantly limiting their potential. In fact, we even tell ourselves stories about why they are happy or engaged: <i>Joe is a steady guy, he just likes to do what he does. Maria loves her job, and she just can’t imagine doing anything else; I am happy to have her and need stability on the team. Andre is a blocker; he’s never really going to be more than what he is, and now he no longer serves the organization...</i> Our stories about them become the truth of who they are, and they fail to lean into their own potential and grow.

My analogies and my stories always have a simple lesson, and in this one what I know is that our job as leaders is not to decide on others’ limitations—especially those of individuals whose differences do not align with our own experiences—our role is to create a space for learning. To challenge our team to think beyond what they see in front of them. To encourage persistence. And to look for and support capabilities that they themselves may not connect with. People will show us their limitations, but more importantly, seeing the possibility in a leader’s eyes pushes individuals to do what even they think would be impossible.

What I love about our emerging pipeline services is that we help you move away from looking for limitations and instead focus on what your talent needs to grow and excel so that you create a new story about your people—one that both of you can believe in and learn from.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span>The current business environment is more uncertain, fast-paced, and dynamic than ever before. In this setting, senior teams must think critically about what they can do differently or where they might improve to optimize the performance of their teams and organizations.</span>

<span>An important part of this is having an accurate—and comprehensive—understanding of the team’s top development needs.</span>

<span>Our experience and research indicate that while senior teams often have a clear point of view regarding their development areas, those on the outside looking in—including those in the same organization—can have a different perspective. And this difference matters. By understanding not only their own views regarding their development opportunities but the views of their stakeholders as well, senior teams can attain a more comprehensive understanding of their areas for improvement. In turn, this can help them more fully develop and utilize their team’s capabilities and leverage the strengths of the organization to drive meaningful results.</span>

<span>In light of this, what do senior teams feel are their top areas for improvement? How are they similar or different from the development needs highlighted by those on the outside looking in? What gaps currently exist that, if addressed, could potentially improve the performance of both the teams and their organizations moving forward?</span>

<span>To address these questions, we reviewed data from senior team members and other stakeholders in our database who provided feedback on their leadership teams’ opportunities for improvement as part of RHR's STE Survey<sup>SM</sup> (Senior Team Effectiveness Survey). We analyzed data from 25 different organizations, comparing the open-ended responses of more than 170 senior team members (i.e., members of teams leading an enterprise, business unit, or function) to the feedback provided by more than 540 internal stakeholders (e.g., direct reports, other employees in the organization). There was some alignment in what was highlighted as most important by each group—along with some key differences</span><i><span>.</span></i>
<h2>Similarities</h2>
<span>When asked to identify the top improvement opportunities for their senior teams, team members and their stakeholders alike agreed the teams needed to improve in doing the following:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Developing and clarifying a compelling vision and strategy to guide the organization moving forward.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Communicating the direction and priorities to the broader organization more clearly, frequently, and in multiple ways—and then communicating again.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Building organizational capability by improving all stages of the talent lifecycle, including succession planning and the hiring, development, and retention of strong talent.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Prioritizing more effectively and focusing on only the most important issues.</span></li>
</ul>
<span>The significance of these four development areas is understandable. For an organization to move forward, it is important for senior leadership to define and communicate (repeatedly) a clear direction and ensure only the most critical work—that which supports the vision and strategy—is pursued. They must also hire the right people and/or develop the necessary skills and capabilities within their organizations to achieve their strategic goals.</span>

<span>Indeed, individuals in our sample recommended the senior teams “</span><i><span>develop a clearer, challenging but achievable vision that acts as a better filter for decision making</span></i><span>”; “</span><i><span>present a unified message and deliver it repeatedly</span></i><span>”; and “</span><i><span>eliminate unnecessary efforts that don’t drive the strategy or add business value</span></i><span>.” Senior teams were also urged to “</span><i><span>prioritize talent development and improve capabilities at all levels</span></i><span>.”</span>

<span>Given the importance of addressing these development opportunities, there would be great value in removing any potential obstacles that might stand in the way. What possible barriers, if removed, could help senior teams improve in these areas more effectively? Data from their stakeholders may provide some useful clues.</span>
<h2>Differences</h2>
<span>While senior teams and their stakeholders were aligned on several key areas for improvement, the stakeholders highlighted two additional development opportunities for the senior teams:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Be more visible. Get out and engage more with others in the organization.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Empower others. Delegate and push down decision-making authority so everyone, including members of the senior team, can work at the right level.</span></li>
</ul>
<span>Addressing these two development areas could better enable senior teams to attend more effectively to the opportunities for improvement listed in the section above.</span>

<span>First of all, by empowering others to take on additional work and by delegating work appropriately, senior teams could have more time to focus on higher-level and longer-term objectives. These could include developing a vision and strategy for the future and determining how best to manage talent given their strategic goals. Indeed, stakeholders recommended the senior teams </span><i><span>“stay out of the day-to-day issues that should be handled by the lower levels</span></i><span>” and “</span><i><span>trust and empower their employees and stop micromanaging, which should free up some of their time</span></i><span>.”</span>

<span>Secondly, spending more time with others in the organization—whether through direct interactions, town halls, etc.—would give senior teams not only the opportunity to communicate more frequently with their employees (enabling greater alignment) but also would help leaders have a better sense of the pulse of the organization and its needs. The senior teams in our sample were encouraged to </span><i><span>“increase visibility in the organization so employees can see them and interact with them”</span></i><span> and “</span><i><span>engage more frequently with all levels of the organization to better understand the employee experience.”</span></i>

<span>Additionally, increased contact with employees may allow leaders to more clearly see where there are gaps in capabilities or skills, allowing them to either address these gaps directly (e.g., through mentoring or providing training opportunities) or better understand how talent management practices (e.g., talent acquisition, development, retention programs) must change to address these gaps moving forward.</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<span>When asked to provide feedback on the development opportunities for their senior teams, both senior team members and their stakeholders recommended the teams focus on improving in the following areas: developing a vision and strategy, improving communication and messaging to the rest of the organization, focusing more on talent management, and prioritizing more effectively. The stakeholders also highlighted two additional areas for improvement that if addressed effectively could potentially help senior teams better tackle other development opportunities. Namely, the stakeholders noted the senior teams could 1) be more visible and spend more time with employees and 2) delegate more work as needed. Thus, while the senior teams had a perspective on where they could improve, taking into consideration the unique perspectives of their stakeholders led to a more complete picture of the teams’ development opportunities—and additional ways to potentially address them moving forward.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A Unique Operating Environment</h3>
<span>Most private equity firms have high levels of debt. They require constant attention to cash flow, spending, debt repayment, and financial targets so their companies can exit in two to five years. In addition, there is the issue of the company owner’s sale and exit, which rarely exists in public company environments. The overriding requirement is to manage and pay down debt in reasonable time frames.</span>

<span>Private equity requires CEOs and their teams to be aggressive in making big restructurings and changes in trying to run and fix companies. In doing this, they need to operate with a speed often uncharacteristic of public organizations. The private equity firm is focused on fewer goals and a defined endgame frequently outlined in financial terms.</span>

<span>In addition, portfolio companies typically have fewer human and financial resources than their corporate counterparts. Private equity CEOs usually need to have a broader grasp of business functions and be able to make decisions that might be delegated in public companies.</span>

<span>Private equity stakes for CEOs and top teams are generally illiquid and long term—different than the conventional equity incentives of corporate stock options that vest annually. Longer-term and inherent illiquidity associated with private equity deals requires CEOs and their top teams to plan and make decisions over a three-to-five-year period. They must be adapted to medium-term value creation.</span>

<span>Despite the pressure for results, CEOs and top teams of private equity firms do not have to address the reporting requirements of public companies. Freed of analysts’ quarterly reporting demands and publicity, they can take a longer-term view of affairs and possibly even cut some corners.</span>
<h3>Traits of Successful Private Equity CEOs</h3>
<span>Each private equity business is normally guided by a leader with specialized industry knowledge. Because of the debt burden, private equity CEOs must also possess solid financial knowledge and expertise. They must know how to manage high debt and reduce costs, and they need to be focused on capital management and debt reduction. Real financial savvy is key as financial strategies command the most attention. Private equity firms have added new, more complex measuring sticks to business, which means CEOs need to be more than just numerate or simply able to read and manipulate the (corporate) P&amp;L.</span>

<span>Besides solid financial expertise, private equity CEOs typically have broad experience in every function, particularly product development, supply chain, sales, and marketing: They are generalists. Behaviorally, they excel at prioritizing, allocating resources, and resolving conflict over goals. They must create and run streamlined businesses, so they have to adapt to any lacking resources and be flexible enough to run lean.</span>

<span>Leaders need to have a ruthless decisiveness that functional and public company executives often lack. They must be quick to make tough, important commercial and financial choices. Typical failures of struggling portfolio leaders include being unable to remove inadequate executives and cut overhead quickly.</span>

<span>They also must be comfortable with high risk and uncertainties. Management can earn huge payouts if the deal thesis is actualized. Unlike public companies that seek to deliver steady returns to shareholders and where executives are often rewarded for playing it safe, private equity CEOs have to provide entrepreneurial leadership and pursue proactive change.</span>

<span>Private equity portfolio companies typically lead autonomous businesses in decentralized organizational structures. Leaders must be able to select, motivate, and mobilize small top teams to deliver commercial results in strict adherence to investors’ time frames. At the same time, they must forge effective board-level partnerships with frequently intrusive, hands-on, financially astute owners. They must operate independently most of the time yet recognize when they need to be collaborative.</span>
<h3>The Importance of Leadership</h3>
<span>The leaders of private equity portfolio companies are a special breed. They lead takeover targets to higher levels of operating returns as compared with their corporate owners. They are usually best in class in their functional specialism, financially savvy, long-term thinkers, ruthlessly decisive, risk takers, operationally strong, and psychologically able to shoulder the burden of high debt and to initiate and pursue drastic change to pay it down fast. Beyond individual capabilities, they must be able to corral, engage, and lead others. Each operating environment has its unique challenges and opportunities, but here are a critical handful of leadership requirements confirmed by our portfolio CEOs that transcend the majority of operating environments:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Quickly getting the right people into the right roles.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Ensuring the entire organization knows its priorities and objectives.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Digging in and focusing on the details that matter.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Balancing the need to be autonomous with the flexibility and openness to both leverage and engage the board.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Understanding the dynamics of the business better than anyone else.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Thinking like a board member … not just like a CEO.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Knowing how, where, and when to modulate the pace button.</span></li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span>Organizations invest money in assessing, measuring, and modifying a leader’s behavior in the hopes that a few nudges can push the needle. This is not a wasted effort; there is much evidence to demonstrate that this is a worthwhile exercise. But can we do a better job at identifying and understanding a leader’s talents? Yes. And machine learning may be the key.</span>

<span>You may have heard of studies that have used </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Winsborough/publication/317394924_The_datafication_of_talent_how_technology_is_advancing_the_science_of_human_potential_at_work/links/59f27d7b0f7e9beabfcc6496/The-datafication-of-talent-how-technology-is-advancing-the-science-of-human-potential-at-work.pdf"><span>algorithms</span></a><span> that translate your Facebook likes, Twitter feed, or even your facial expressions and voice into highly accurate models of personality, personal values and talent. These models are remarkably accurate due to machine learning algorithms that can spot patterns in data that are too complex for humans to understand. There is no reason we cannot leverage similar approaches to better understand leadership talent. The more we can utilize data and empirical models of behavior, the better our predictions and evaluations of leadership potential will be.</span>

<span>In light of this and inspired by a </span><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/big-data-gives-the-big-5-personality-traits-a-makeover/"><span>recent paper</span></a><span> that used machine learning to demonstrate that the “Big Five” personality profiles (i.e. Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) could be organized into four discrete types, we sought to identify typologies within our </span><a href="#"><span>Readiness for Scale</span></a><span><sup>SM</sup> (RFS) model of leadership. The RFS model contains nine behavioral dimensions that can be organized into three domains: the ability to lead the business, lead people, and lead oneself. You can learn more about this model and its dimensions </span><a href="https://rhrinternational.us8.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4ca69eb098add35efb535765d&amp;id=026883ff70"><b>here</b></a><span>. With thousands of possible configurations, it is a comprehensive model of leadership. So, we wondered: can machine learning methods reveal the core roles a leader can play? To answer this question, we leveraged a dataset containing more than 600 leaders who were assessed against the nine RFS model dimensions. Using a </span><a href="https://www.datascience.com/blog/k-means-clustering"><span>popular machine learning algorithm</span></a><span>, we can describe leaders as playing one of the four roles:</span>
<h2><b>The Strategist</b></h2>
<span>Strategists score high on the </span><i><span>Leading Business </span></i><span>domain, while their scores are somewhat average on the </span><i><span>Leading</span></i> <i><span>People</span></i><span> and</span><i><span> Leading Self </span></i><span>domains. These leaders can be described as bright, technical, business-savvy thinkers who do a great job at following industry trends to shape strategy, are capable of making decisions that positively impact the entire business, and can balance pursuing short-term goals with building capability for the future. While their orientations toward data, systems, and processes can help create growth and progress, it does get in the way of influencing and connecting with others.</span>
<h2><b>The Influencer</b></h2>
<span>Influencers score high on the </span><i><span>Leading People</span></i><span> domain, below average on the </span><i><span>Leading Business</span></i><span> domain, and average on the</span><i><span> Leading Self </span></i><span>domain. They can be described as interpersonally skilled and relationship-focused individuals. They are effective at driving clarity and alignment among followers and key stakeholders, delivering compelling messages that galvanize and inspire action, and creating cultures that positively shape behaviors and decisions throughout the organization. Influencers have a complementary style to Strategists: despite an affinity and connection with people, they struggle with strategic and technical thinking.</span>
<h2><b>The Executor</b></h2>
<span>Executors typically score in the mid ranges across the nine RFS model dimensions, meaning that they are steady and well-rounded leaders. While they are neither rock stars nor truly incompetent, Executors can be trusted to achieve their goals and get stuff done yet are likely to struggle to influence and set direction for the entire enterprise. They do their best work managing small- to medium-size teams where they can implement another’s vision and strategy.</span>
<h2><b>The Change Agent</b></h2>
<span>Change Agents score above average across all RFS model dimensions. Such individuals have a style that enables them to lead at scale and create organizational growth. That is, they set an ambitious and achievable strategy for the organization, inspire and galvanize action in others, and remain emotionally aware and productive when under extreme pressure. These leaders are driven, interpersonally sensitive, and highly curious. That said, they are not without their flaws: they tend to be fairly bold and mischievous, which can lead to overconfidence and harmful rule breaking if left unchecked.</span>

<span>As you read through these descriptions, you can agree that they are intuitive and make practical sense. We are sure that you can identify with one of the four types—and certainly sort your colleagues among these types. The takeaway, however, is that machine learning methods were used to churn through a large and complex database to identify a handful of core leadership styles that were not immediately obvious. The more data we collect from leaders and from more diverse places, the greater the role machine learning can play in our leadership assessment and development efforts. Such technologies can help us become less biased and better judges of talent and ultimately improve our ability to help organizations achieve their goals.</span>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span>One of the most difficult career transitions occurs when you have been a long-term employee of one company and are leaving to move to a new job. The emotions surrounding the transition represent a mixture of excitement and trepidation, coupled with a profound sense of loss. Transitioning executives are energized by the challenges and learning that the new environment will bring but can face a crisis of competence in adjusting to a new culture with a novel set of success factors.</span>

<span>It will be important to get a sense of closure regarding the ending of your old job so that you can fully engage in the opportunity ahead. Factors such as the timing of the transition relative to your life plan, the amount of control that you had in the decision to leave your old job, your previous experience with career change, and your personal flexibility will play a large role in how effectively you adjust to the move.</span>

<span>Getting a fast start in your new company requires forethought and planning. Here are some considerations:</span>
<h2>Do your research.</h2>
<span>Investing time researching your new company before entry will pay dividends after you join. This should include learning more about its history as well as its current status. Understanding the timeline of how the organization was formed will provide insight into the culture and customs. Scour the internet to uncover articles about your new company and be sure to review its annual report and 10K. A thorough review of the website will also provide clues about what is important for success in your new environment. Learning more about the company’s products and services will help you hit the ground running.</span>
<h2>Reinvigorate your network.</h2>
<span>Maintain a healthy professional network, which will help ease your transition. What relationships do you want to keep? Which ones do you jettison? Networks take effort to maintain, and it is all too easy to lose touch with your former colleagues. Investing in maintaining connections is a wise investment—you may be able to partner with them in the future for advice, either as a source of recruiting talent and/or for insight about the marketplace. Moving forward, sit down with your new manager and ask about who the key influencers in the organization are. Ask your boss or human resources liaison to broker some meetings between you and these new resources. Establishing friendly relationships with key internal opinion leaders will help you to get things done more quickly and effectively in your new environment.</span>
<h2>Clarify and focus.</h2>
<span>Gain clarity about your new role, which will help you to be more efficient about how to spend your time. Many executives have delivered what they thought was a good job, only to find out after the fact that it was not the job the boss wanted them to do. Get a thorough understanding of what </span><i><span>good</span></i><span> looks like for your new manager. One way to do this is to ask “If I am to earn an ‘exceeds expectations’ rating on next year’s performance evaluation, what will I have delivered between now and then?” This will help you to focus your efforts on the most important accountabilities and provide your manager with more relevant reporting on your progress regarding key projects.</span>
<h2>Manage your brand.</h2>
<span>New jobs represent an opportunity to redefine your personal brand. Reflect on what has made you most successful and how that will need to change in the future. Bringing the same old modus operandi to a new situation can be a recipe for disaster. What has made you successful in the past is not necessarily the same thing that will make you successful in the future. Think about where your new organization is headed and develop expertise in areas that will ensure your relevance through change. When meeting your new colleagues, tell them about your most applicable attributes while deemphasizing the capabilities that are less important to success in the new environment.</span>
<h2>Lead through others.</h2>
<span>Nothing will help your reputation more than helping others to deliver results. Gather information about which outcomes are most valued in the new business and focus your efforts on the activities that will help others drive success as they define it. To do so, consider embarking upon a listening tour where you can learn more about what other people’s business strategies and goals are. In that way, you can look for opportunities to align your efforts with their objectives and establish mutually advantageous partnerships. Making others look good is a key sign of leadership effectiveness and will bind you to your new organization.</span>
<h2>Focus forward.</h2>
<span>It will be important for you to keep looking to the future to manage your transition successfully. Refrain from mentioning your old company and what you did there. No one wants to hear you say “While I was at my old company, we used to…” Instead, offer the best practice as an alternative without mentioning the source. Articulating an optimistic view of the future and expressing humble appreciation for the platform that you have been given will help you ingratiate yourself into the new environment. Finally, by identifying opportunities to lead change in your workplace, you can establish your leadership and maximize your influence and impact in your new role.</span>

<span>There is much work to be done in setting the stage for a successful transition to a new job. By being thoughtful and intentional about the change, you can take charge of your career path and establish a sense of self-efficacy during a time that can seem chaotic and intimidating. Seize the opportunity inherent in change and commit to a plan that enables your future success. Good luck and bon voyage!</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Human Capital Leader, Melissa Mounce, Baird Capital</h3>
<i><span>This is the second and final part of our interview with Melissa Mounce who is human capital leader, Baird Capital, an RHR client. </span></i><a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/assessing-talent-small-t-transformation-and-change-readiness"><i><span>Read part 1</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i>

<span>RHR International works with Melissa Mounce, human capital leader, Baird Capital, which has made venture capital, growth equity, and private equity investments in more than 300 portfolio companies with a focus on healthcare, industrial solutions, and technology and services.</span>

<span>Because human capital has such a profound effect on a portfolio company’s potential and success, Melissa partners with investment team colleagues and their companies across its portfolios to build talent strategies and teams to drive value and growth.</span>

<span>She is recognized as much for her pragmatic business acumen as her ability to effectively influence organizations and improve business performance by appropriately optimizing talent.</span>

<span>At a variety of high-profile companies, Melissa has been a global business strategist, emerging market business developer, business process management consultant, global operations/outsourcing leader, and talent management leader.  </span>

<span>Melissa currently serves on the board of directors of R2i, a Baird Capital portfolio company, and  the advisory board for ASCEND, a group created to attract and retain women at Baird. She has an MBA from Northern Illinois University and has participated in International/Global Studies at Université Stendhal (Grenoble III).</span>

<span>RHR International’s senior partner Grant Levitan spoke with Melissa about Baird’s approach to the various forms of due diligence, the four pillars that most affect change readiness, and the impact executives’ and their companies’ change readiness has on overall organizational effectiveness.</span>

<b>Grant:</b> <b>What are the various forms of due diligence that you routinely engage in when investing in portfolio companies</b><span>?</span>

<b>Melissa:</b><span> In addition to human capital due diligence, we perform extensive due diligence in areas such as market, financial, and legal. However, we do believe a company’s human capital is one of the most important factors that impact its ability to achieve its true potential and ultimate success. As a result, we believe our firm goes well beyond the typical human capital due diligence in effort to ensure the company has the talent required to reach our goals. This resonates with our investment colleagues who have a heavy financial focus.</span>

<span>The question we want to address is, does the existing team have the skillsets, expertise, and experience required to apply the new and improved strategies that will take the company to the next level? Their readiness and capabilities may indicate the executive team requires development or new talent, all of which will have a measurable, quantifiable effect on everything from timelines to budgets and the bottom line.</span>

<b>Grant:</b> <b>How does Baird assess the executives’ and the company’s change readiness, both of which are integral to the overall organizational effectiveness?</b>

<b>Melissa:</b><span> We assess their change readiness, using one-on-one interviews and a standard framework to determine the company’s maturity in various areas. Once we confirm the foundation is in place, we need to identify gaps so we know what we need to shore up before overlaying new initiatives.</span>

<b>Grant:</b> <b>How does Baird assess the four pillars that most impact change readiness: organizational structure, talent, operating culture, and change readiness itself?</b>

<b>Melissa:</b><span> Baird creates customized templates and questions for each pillar. In one-on-one interviews with various executives and employees, we’re looking for consistent answers to identical questions from the various individuals. If we don’t get consensus, we know there is a fundamental disconnect in how the company, its culture, maturity level, and operational effectiveness are perceived internally.</span>

<b>Grant:</b> <b>How much manpower and time are required to conduct these organizational assessments</b><span>?</span>

<b>Melissa:</b><span> Typically, I partner with a consultant to conduct the 45- to 60-minute, one-on-one, on-site interviews, which generally take one (and up to two) full days. Because we want them to answer the questions as candidly as possible, we don’t share the interview questions with the subjects ahead of time.</span>

<span>People being assessed tend to be very forthcoming, cooperative, and informative because they appreciate the fact that a private equity firm is interested and taking the time to really understand their organization. They want to be heard! </span>

<span>These interviews create a sense of respect and inclusiveness. The executives and leadership teams become a part of the process and recognize that we customize our approach and business models rather than simply replicating what we do company to company. </span>

<b>Grant:</b> <b>From your perspective, what is the biggest payoff with organizational assessments?</b><span> </span>

<b>Melissa:</b><span> The organizational assessments help determine the company's current capabilities and tell us how we need to develop and position the company for future success.</span>

<span>Baird’s goal is the creation of immediate growth and value. But, prior to any investment, our due diligence depends on organizational assessments to provide clarity on the actual state of the company. The organizational assessments may indicate inadequate foundations that require shoring up to support our initiatives. Unless Baird gives the leadership, infrastructure, systems, and processes the attention they warrant, we’ll face inadequate traction and progress down the road. </span>

<span>Immediate gratification is rare, and the reality is that Baird often devotes significant dollars and many months to closing the foundational gaps and carefully positioning a company for the future.</span>

<i><span>We’d like to thank Melissa for taking the time to sit with us and talk in such depth.</span></i>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Human Capital Leader, Melissa Mounce, Baird Capital</h2>
<i><span>This is part 1 of our interview with Melissa Mounce.</span></i>

<span>RHR International works with Melissa Mounce, human capital leader, Baird Capital. Baird Capital created her role because human capital has such a profound effect on a portfolio company’s potential and success. Melissa partners with investment team colleagues and their companies across its portfolios to build talent strategies and teams to drive value and growth.</span>

<span>Baird Capital makes venture capital, growth equity, and private equity investments in strategically targeted sectors globally. Baird Capital has raised and managed more than $3.5 billion and invested in more than 300 portfolio companies with a focus on healthcare, industrial solutions, and technology and services.</span>

<span>Throughout her career, Melissa has been a global business strategist, emerging market business developer, business process management consultant, global operations/outsourcing leader, and talent management leader at a variety of high-profile companies.</span>

<span>She is recognized as much for her pragmatic business acumen as her ability to effectively influence organizations and improve business performance by appropriately optimizing talent. She is a frequent public speaker and panelist on private equity human capital and talent management. Her thought leadership has appeared in white papers and periodicals such as the</span><i><span> Wall Street Journal.</span></i>

<span>Melissa currently serves on the board of directors of R2i, a Baird Capital portfolio company. She also serves on the advisory board for ASCEND, Baird’s internal associate resource group that aims to attract and retain women at all levels of the firm. She has an MBA from Northern Illinois University and has participated in International/Global Studies at Université Stendhal (Grenoble III). She is an active member with the Guild Board of Directors at Lyric Opera in Chicago.</span>

<span>RHR International’s senior partner Grant Levitan spoke with Melissa about Baird’s approach to assessing talent for transformation and change readiness, and why these assessments resonate with colleagues.</span>

<b>Grant: What do you look for in a talent due-diligence assessment?</b>

<b>Melissa:</b><span> There are three primary things we look for in our talent due-diligence assessments. First and foremost, I believe that to compare, contrast, and evaluate the companies that Baird is considering for investment, we need a taxonomy that enables a transparent, common classification system that is understood by all. That taxonomy is rooted in the use of a consistent methodology and our commitment to applying that same methodology every single time. Because our teams are so familiar with these apples-to-apples methodologies, they’re comfortable turning to them first rather than seeking new and different approaches.</span>

<span>Second, we rely on specialized professionals with industrial-organizational psychology capabilities and relevant experience to interpret the talent due-diligence assessment findings.</span>

<span>Finally, we collaborate with RHR because they provide the objective perspective that our investment teams lack when considering targeted acquisitions simply because they’re inherently biased toward the deal.</span>

<b>Grant: You value a consistent taxonomy, yet you also customize and adapt assessments to each individual, company, and situation. Why?</b><span> </span>

<b>Melissa:</b><span> We’ve never believed that five specific attributes make a CEO successful, because the requisite characteristics will vary based on factors such as diverse markets, geographies, corporate culture, and the company’s maturity.</span>

<span>Baird’s approach is appreciating the value of both standardization tools and customization of the situation, hence our reliance on standard but customized assessments. Our standardized assessment tools provide the building blocks, but we tailor them to the individual executives, companies, and their unique situations to ensure they are relevant.</span>

<b>Grant:</b> <b>How do you customize your assessment tools for exceptional individuals facing complex situations?</b>

<b>Melissa:</b><span> Before we customize our assessments, we carefully consider our plans and end-goals for the company. We can then identify what we’ll need from the executives to reach those targets in terms of cultural fit, expertise, skillsets, and the executives’ experience.</span>

<span>Our customized assessment tool may show us that the senior leaders already have the relevant expertise and experience as well as the perfect attitude, they just haven’t had the opportunity to apply them in the current environment. It may also indicate they lack the attributes required to take the company in a different direction and to the next level.</span>

<b>Grant:</b> <b>How important is culture when assessing a company’s executives and their willingness to partner with Baird?</b>

<b>Melissa:</b><span> The assessment tools are designed to tell us how a company and its employees at all levels will react to change for the sake of transformation and whether the company’s leadership team can take it from this inflection point to the end-goals set out by Baird. </span>

<span>Baird’s partnership model means we’re with the companies throughout the process. As a private-equity investor, Baird’s “path to value,” which was developed to support the success of its companies and their leaders, is about partnering for small “t” rather than big “T” transformation. Small incremental changes and enhancements rather than massive change may be all that’s required to alter an outcome, but that doesn’t mean the executive team will be open to it.</span>

<span>Baird rarely, if ever, asks a company to completely change their business model. However, we inevitably ask executives to make adjustments, and their perspectives on their company’s culture tell us how receptive they’ll be when the time comes. On occasion, we know something is off, but we need the assessment tool to tell us exactly what it is and whether it’s a showstopper or it can be addressed. </span>

<b>Grant:</b> <b>What is the most valuable part of the assessment process?</b><span> </span>

<b>Melissa:</b><span> Our post-assessment conversations internally and with RHR are incredibly valuable and an integral part of our assessment process. The written reports are important, but they simply present the facts. The conversation, on the other hand, encourages a layered, multidimensional evaluation.</span>

<span>Together, we really dig into the data and look at how certain characteristics could impact specific scenarios and what risks they might present. The completed assessments help us size up the executive(s) potential and risks relative to our value creation strategies. Our goal isn’t to derail an investment; rather, we are looking for solutions and ways to mitigate risks, if possible.</span>

<span>These highly interactive evaluations ensure that the Baird team’s perceptions of the data are aligned and that we’re all seeing the results the same way. It allows us to build consensus and walk away with a shared understanding—that’s invaluable.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span>The higher up you go within hierarchical organizational structures, the more powerful the roles become, with the CEO being the most powerful. Our research and experience show that leaders cast long shadows over their organizations. In this way, every single behavior matters when it comes to the engagement of employees many levels below them.</span>

<span>Based on an analysis of responses from executives who completed RHR’s Senior Team Effectiveness Survey and who represent the top leadership teams in over 100 organizations, we found two areas that serve as key drivers of engagement: (1) the extent to which leaders are connected to the pulse of the organization and (2) the norms shaped by leaders at the top.</span>
<ol>
 	<li>
<h3>Staying grounded matters</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<span>Top-performing senior teams with the most impact on employee engagement stay grounded in reality and connected to the pulse of their organizations. As consultants who work at the top of the organization, we have run across more than one top team in their own version of an “ivory tower” and disconnected from their organizations’ reality. </span>

<span>A poignant example of this is the top team of a large financial services company that filled the employee intranet (the firm’s primary communication tool) with “get to know the top team” tidbits such as “guess whose baby picture </span><span>this is?” and other inconsequential information while the company was going through tumultuous organizational changes (delayering, acquisitions, etc.). The disconnect of the top team was profound. </span>

<span>On the other hand, senior leaders and the CEO can demonstrate their willingness to understand the reality by systematically taking the organizational pulse through various means. One great method that a technology client utilized was an exercise called “get the ugly out.” Before the top team would commit to the annual operating plan, they would have sessions around the company where people would dress in costumes (an interesting psychological technique to loosen everyone up and suspend the normal trepidation) and use Post-it notes to write down all the things that would get in the way of achieving the annual plan’s objectives, essentially “getting the ugly out.” The CEO and team members would actively facilitate these sessions, grouping themes into priority areas to address. While the exercise may seem unconventional, in the end, the CEO and team had a better understanding of potential hurdles while simultaneously demonstrating their willingness to step down from that “ivory tower.”</span>

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2026" src="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1061-277x300.png" alt="" width="277" height="300" />
<ol start="2">
 	<li>
<h3>Norms shape the team and the culture below</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<span>Another area that impacts employee engagement is the way the leader establishes and enforces the norms at the top. Norms can be defined as the behaviors we choose to demonstrate to each other that have the most profound influence on our team performance. The norms demonstrated by high-functioning senior teams shape culture and engagement in noticeably impactful ways. The top team norms that we found to have the most impact on employee engagement produced the following emotional states:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Feeling heard and recognized</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Optimism as characterized by learning, getting feedback, and developing new skills</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Pride in the team, its mission, purpose, and focus</span></li>
</ul>
<span>It is critically important for the leader to define team norms and hold team members (including themselves) accountable, yet occasionally, some senior leaders can underestimate the power of norms for both the health of the team </span><span>and the organization below them. In one large pharmaceutical client, the CEO was hesitant to uphold norms out of fear of alienating a team member who held sway over key board members. However, that team member was behaving badly, shutting out another team member on crucial decisions. The behavior was so extreme that entire functions below these two leaders would not communicate horizontally, but funneled everything up their chain of command to their boss so their boss would have more information at his disposal than his peer. The organization coined the term “Information Olympics” to characterize the insanity of the behavior that permeated the culture. Needless to say, the unhealthy norms at the top led to dysfunctional behaviors levels below and severely impacted employee engagement.</span>

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2028" src="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/1062-259x300.png" alt="" width="259" height="300" />

<span>As the talent market continues to heat up, employee engagement remains a top priority for leadership. Staying grounded in reality and upholding team norms are two less obvious behaviors that CEOs and senior executives can focus on to fortify their efforts at creating healthy, sustainable organizations…sustainable organizations where all employees are able to thrive.   </span>

<i><span>Determining which direction to take your company in is one thing; knowing how to get there is another. To learn how RHR can help your senior teams establish a clear direction and align behavior around it while enhancing your team’s ability to work together to achieve their organizational goals and create impact on the bottom line, contact Orla Leonard, Practice Leader, Senior Team Effectiveness.</span></i>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span>In the pursuit of good governance, the board of directors of publicly held companies meet four or more times per year, and some board committees meet even more frequently. There is quite a bit written regarding the need for directors to come to these meetings well-prepared, having read the board materials in advance, and ready to contribute their questions, insights, and experience to the dialogue.</span>

<span>Not surprisingly, these meetings also require a substantial investment on the part of the executive team and their people in terms of preparation. However, the amount of effort invested by the organization is not always commensurate with the amount of traction and impact generated by the board discussion. Extreme levels of preparation can generate unproductive levels of anxiety and divert executive attention away from running the business, as if a board meeting represents the potential threat of a category five hurricane. Monitoring the extent of this investment relative to the impact of the board discussions can provide a meaningful indicator regarding the quality of the partnership and communication between the senior team and the board and the health of board dynamics. </span>

<span>Providing the information necessary for good governance and setting the stage for crucial conversations that mine the collective wisdom of the board are worthy investments of any C-suite team. But, like any investment, it is helpful to monitor the ROI and factors that can negatively impact the result. Over the past several years in the board evaluations we have conducted for clients, the following situations have emerged that cause executive teams and their staff to invest significantly more than the overall return would suggest:</span>
<h2>When CEOs and their teams are managing their board versus leveraging their board.</h2>
<b> </b><span>Inundating board meetings with highly polished decks and presentations filled with data to support the targeted path with little time for actual dialogue helps to control discussions at the board level and avoid deeper and possibly more challenging conversations. However, this approach requires considerable time preparing and vetting decks and rehearsing presentations to ensure a consistent and uncontroversial message among presenters. This road is generally either built by or leads over time to a lack of trust between management and the board.</span>
<h2>Individual directors driving their own agenda.</h2>
<span>Unfortunately, this is not uncommon and takes on many forms. Directors may seek to prove their expertise through irrelevant, distracting questions or comments; others may appear to vie for the CEO role through disparaging the current leader and his or her team. Some directors manage their personal anxiety regarding the current level of ambiguity or perceived risk through a series of requests for more data, and others embark on a quest to catch executives in trivial mistakes and prove an underlying assumption of incompetence. While irritating and disruptive to fellow board members, over time, these behaviors can create corrosive levels of churn within an organization seeking to meet these requests and avoid problems at the board level. Left unchecked, this also leads to a lack of faith in the rest of the board who appear to condone this behavior.</span>
<h2>Misalignment among board members.</h2>
<span>When the expectations or direction are unclear, executives and their teams are forced to cover more options than are merited. For example, if there is a lack of alignment at the board level regarding an acquisition strategy, teams can spend an inordinate amount of time and energy pursuing and vetting options that will never generate sufficient support at the board level to move forward.</span>
<h2>Unsurfaced or unacknowledged conflicts.</h2>
<span>When individuals in power do not address their differences, the impact is more visible in the next level down. Significant and ongoing disconnects between the CEO and the board, or between individual board members can generate substantial wear and tear on those in the organization seeking to meet conflicting expectations and avoid stepping on metaphorical interpersonal land mines.</span>
<h2>Raw data versus polished summaries.</h2>
<span>Directors who are trying to learn the business, or those joining the board due to questions about company performance, tend to desire access to more detailed and unvarnished data and reports. However, without direct conversations about what would be helpful, the directors will likely be given polished summaries versus more rough, detailed reports. Unless caught early, this disconnect can create an increasingly negative cycle with directors becoming progressively frustrated or distrustful with a perceived lack of transparency and asking for more information, which in turn generates additional work to meet the demands of directors who appear never to be satisfied.</span>

<span>Preparing for worthwhile discussions, even if time-consuming, can actually be energizing for executives. The preparation itself can force a team to step back, check assumptions, and fine-tune perceptions. Engaging in rigorous, challenging dialogue on key issues that matter in a process that leverages the combined expertise in a room of seasoned individuals from a broad range of backgrounds increases both the caliber of the decisions and the odds of success for the enterprise. However, the return needs to justify the investment. Lead directors, board chairs, and CEOs collectively bear the responsibility for ensuring the resources dedicated by the organization in preparing for board meetings are justified by the ensuing dialogue and decisions.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Drinking from the money fountain</h2>
<span>Over the last five years, the private equity industry has experienced tremendous growth; a sustained period of low interest rates has made it very attractive to investors. As a result, the money raised by private equity firms has grown substantially, and the largest funds in history have been created and focused on global opportunities. At the same time, there are not as many easy targets in the market. This smaller number of solid available opportunities command higher prices—and a higher price at entry naturally makes it harder to achieve an attractive return on exit, driving a shift in focus from finding lower-priced assets to experimenting with methods of creating stronger returns.</span>

<span>To achieve the level of returns demanded by investors, holding periods are increasing. Several large private equity firms have launched funds with longer lives than have previously been the norm. One particular firm raised $5 billion for a fund with holding periods that are expected to be around twice as long as those of traditional buyout funds. As a result, value creation over the long term becomes the most important driver, and investors will favor firms that can create genuine value through the transformation of companies in their portfolio, and not only through clever, short-term financial engineering. Being smarter about leadership is one way to create value. Doing this requires a shift in the relationship between private equity professionals and portfolio company CEOs. This is particularly true when it comes to the ways in which operating partners help portfolio companies take a longer-term approach to managing leadership talent.</span>
<h2>Changed thesis, changed context, same leaders?</h2>
<span>The shift in ownership brings with it a significant change to the context and drivers of success for the portfolio company: moving from being family-owned, moving from being an organization conceived and created by an entrepreneurial innovator, moving from being carved out of a larger global multinational, or moving from a stand-alone company to a merged entity. All such moves bring a shift in approach, and a change in leadership is needed to make them successful as organizations.</span>

<span>Private equity investment professionals invest a lot of time and attention in developing and managing relationships with portfolio company CEOs and management teams. They are increasingly focused on the value they can add in helping CEOs by using their networks and facilitating access to M&amp;A targets. When it comes to adding value to leadership, private equity firms have become very adept at doing the due diligence of CEOs and CFOs and perhaps at looking in depth at particular aspects of the business. Deal makers, however, are less focused when it comes to understanding whether the company has the right leaders to take the organization to the next level and the role they can play in the longer-term transformation of the company. This highlights a real opportunity for operating partners to help portfolio company CEOs look deeper into their organizations to ensure that there is a robust pipeline of future leaders who can continue to take the company in the right direction and achieve the investment thesis over the long term. This goes beyond looking at how many people have potential and instead identifies those who have what it takes to lead at greater scale, be it at a larger organization, in a more complex operation, or over a more diverse geographical spread.</span>
<h2>How private equity-focused professionals can help</h2>
<span>As an investor for the longer term, how can private equity-focused professionals contribute? The relationships with the portfolio company require a balance in focus between achieving goals that create long-term value and avoiding too much day-to-day interference. That said, here are some questions portfolio company CEOs should be encouraged to consider:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Are you looking at the strength and depth of talent the way you are looking at the financials?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Do you have the right talent in the right places to execute the investment thesis successfully?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Is the organization generally set up to scale? What systems and processes need to be added or taken away to support getting to and succeeding at greater scale?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Is the current culture and ways of working helping or hindering future success, and do you have the right leaders who will not only be role models for the future way of working, but will create the kind of environment around themselves that will drive long-term success?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Do you have a sense of the strengths and gaps in your talent pipeline when it comes to meeting the specific challenges for the future and positioning the organization for longer-term success?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Do you know how many of your leaders are ready to take on the challenges of increasing scale and complexity, and do you know where they are now?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>If so, how are you defining </span><i><span>talent</span></i><span>? How does it add value to the company?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>And finally, how are you developing the capacity to drive even further growth?</span></li>
</ul>
<span>As achieving returns on investments becomes more difficult and holding periods become longer, private equity firms can benefit from being smarter about leadership. They can recognize that added value can be achieved by looking beyond current leadership to develop the next generation of leaders who can turn a longer-term investment thesis into daily action and tangible returns.</span>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many good reasons to consider using action learning as part of your leadership development approach. Building on the work of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Lewin"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kurt Lewin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reg_Revans"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Reg Revans</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and others, </span><a href="https://www.bsn.eu/faculty-and-research/action-learning-center/action-learning-action-research/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">action learning</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is based on solid science of adult learning. It has been embraced by organizations around the world and is used in prominent executive development leadership programs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Action learning is typically used to engage groups of high-potential leaders in addressing real problems the organization is facing. It emphasizes asking the right questions and seeking data from inside and outside the organization to answer them. The work of these teams is designed to solve a problem, generate new thinking, or improve an aspect of organizational life while providing a platform for learning and development.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, however, in our work with organizations, we have seen many attempts at action learning go awry. Indeed, action learning often ends up wasting precious resources and creating unnecessary work and stress for the participants while yielding little in the way of learning or practical problem solving. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five questions to consider in determining whether action learning is right for your organization:</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Are people learning what they need to learn?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Many organizations pay more attention to choosing interesting topics that resonate with executives than thinking about the specific knowledge or skills participants need to learn from the experience. Regardless of the topic, participants will typically gain a broader understanding of the business and have the opportunity to work with people who come from different backgrounds. Is this enough, or are you expecting more targeted skill development?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Do we have the right emphasis on results and learning?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When action learning is well designed, there is a perfect balance on results and learning. Although there is a result or “answer” desired, participants are expected to extract key learnings along the way. However, since most teams will ultimately present their findings to an executive team, potentially including the CEO, the scale can easily tip toward overemphasis on the results side. Presenting to senior officers is understandably a stressful situation for many participants. After all, no one wants to show up in a way that diminishes her chances for a promotion or choice assignment. As a result, action learning teams often end up looking more like a task force in which the learning goals become overshadowed with getting a good result.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Are expectations for deliverables clear and reasonable?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It’s easy for teams to become overwhelmed with the stress of creating the best presentation possible. If they do not have a clear sense of the desired format or length of results, they can waste time trying to make decisions that have little to do with the results or learning. We’ve seen teams spend hours tweaking their decks and discussing who should present what, sometimes even pulling all-nighters before the presentation.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Is the timeframe appropriate</b><b>?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In many cases, teams are given as much as four to six months to complete their project. They are often expected to devote several hours to the project, including regular meetings with the entire team. In multinational organizations, it could mean calls at 5 a.m. or midnight to sync up with geographically dispersed team members. Most of the people who are engaging in action learning projects already have demanding day jobs. An extended timeframe does not necessarily translate into more learning.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Will there be sufficient facilitation and coaching support?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> To be effective, action learning projects need to be carefully facilitated with coaching provided to the team and individuals. This helps the team stay on track while also ensuring that they engage in the necessary pauses to reflect on what is happening and to extract and consolidate the desired learning. Coaching action learning teams is not the same as coaching individuals, and many organizations do not have enough people who can devote the time necessary to coaching the teams. Even when they do, when some of the other challenges described above are present, the team may not be motivated to make time for the coaching.</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If these questions have given you pause about the feasibility of an action learning program, but you still want to reap the benefits of learning by doing, there are other ways to design an effective program without falling prey to pitfalls. Putting clear boundaries around the time spent and expectations for deliverables can go a long way toward increasing the efficiency and impact of the experience. In the RHR Scaling for GrowthSM program, participants complete a practical learning assignment and present it within the course of a day. Another option is to craft specific stretch or “heat” experiences for each person. This could also include having each person design their own special project or assignment to target the skills and experiences needed. Simulations are another good choice for experiential learning. With a defined timeframe and expertly designed and facilitated experiences to build specific skills, simulations can help to ensure that leaders are reaping the right benefits from the experience.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Context is critical in leadership development and you need to choose an approach that works in your organization and fits with other components of your leadership development strategy. Fortunately, there are many options available to you. In our experience, we have learned that when it comes to building the skills needed by the next generation of leaders, there is almost always a more efficient and less painful road to get there than action learning!</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently had the honor of attending the first-ever chief human resources officer (CHRO) summit and networking event hosted by the Johnson &amp; Johnson Human Performance Institute (HPI) and RHR International. This was a customized two-day experience at the HPI headquarters in Orlando, Florida to connect with a cadre of 14 CHRO peers from a wide variety of companies of different sizes, ownership structures, and global reach to build personalized performance plans while generating new tactics and strategies to bring “whole-person leadership” back to our organizations.

We started with a networking dinner prior to the event’s kickoff the next morning that set the stage for engaging and meaningful discussions and partnerships throughout the event and beyond. The next 1½ days set us on our path through active and authentic participation in:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Customized performance training designed to help elevate our own personal performance, including personalized takeaways on how we can increase our energy capacity through physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual well-being.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Moderated discussions on key challenges and opportunities CHROs and their organizations are facing and how character-based leadership can elevate individual and organizational performance.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Facilitated cohort discussions on personal purpose and legacy.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Networking with CHRO peers on a very personal and transparent level.</li>
</ul>
My participation was quite unique in that I was invited both as a new RHR consultant and as a former chief HR officer (my most recent role). I was presented with the great opportunity to share the perspectives and experiences of my fellow participants and newly expanded network of truly talented HR leaders and to simultaneously add new tools to my consulting toolkit. We challenged ourselves physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually and worked with different tools and techniques to help us attain more balanced and positive energy for the people and things that matter most in our lives. This also included learning more about the many types of avenues for exercise, nutrition, and healthy eating habits and ensuring that we are taking adequate time for rest and recovery and, in particular, the importance of all of this in our approach to work, given the many hours we devote and the impact we have on people’s careers and lives.

This event was an amazing opportunity for the group to learn, reflect, and explore in a safe setting, as well as to be reminded of our abundance and gratitude for the many rewards we have reaped in our often intertwined personal and professional lives. Wearing the hats of both a consultant and HR leader throughout this event, I could not help thinking about the many benefits all leaders would derive through their participation and the positive impact it would have on the companies and workforces they lead.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/sites/default/files/pdf_files/Grooming%20a%20World-Class%20Chief%20Executive-Part%201.pdf">part-one</a> of this Executive Insight, we outlined five core dimensions of the role of the chief executive officer. Regardless of the industry or sector, these are the areas where the best CEOs do well in leading their companies to distinguished performance, year after year. But how do great CEOs acquire these capabilities, and what can be done to develop them in succession candidates?

Most executive development professionals agree that extraordinary chief executives are made, not born. After 75 years of working with CEOs, RHR International believes it is possible to accelerate this cultivation timeline as well as the development results. We believe that great leaders result from a great process that thoughtfully does the following:
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1">Defines the industry and business context in detail</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Specifies the CEO leadership role requirements that the context and company strategy will demand</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Produces a thorough assessment of the strengths and gaps against the requirements for each executive being groomed</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Executes carefully selected experiences to leverage strengths and address gaps</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Systematically engages key stakeholders with a vested interest in the intended development outcomes</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">A successful program depends upon both the quality of design and the diligence of execution.</li>
</ol>
In <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/sites/default/files/pdf_files/Grooming-a-World-Class-Chief-Executive-Part-II.pdf">part-two</a> of this Executive Insight, we offer some practical suggestions for achieving excellence in the core dimensions outlined in part one. While these recommendations are specifically targeted to the CEO role, which has many unique requirements, most of the ideas are also applicable to other leadership positions.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Who has the most critical and influential role in every institution? Most people would agree it is the CEO. Not only are the organization’s prospects impacted by the CEO’s leadership, the lives and fortunes of thousands of people, and sometimes entire communities, are affected by their decisions. For this reason, ensuring a capable successor to a sitting chief executive is one of the most important duties of a board of directors. The incumbent CEO and senior HR leaders also have key roles to play in this crucial task. But where do they start? In order to groom a world-class CEO, you must begin by defining the target.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While listed companies have traditionally provided superb training grounds for general managers and future business leaders and are a natural pool of talent for private equity, ultimately a significant number who have thrived in listed companies fail in private equity portfolio firms. Therefore, our assumed models of “what looks good” may not always fit private equity. It is not the same as the joint stock world, legally or culturally. There are certain broad traits that research suggests are important for private equity leaders.

		<title><![CDATA[Five Challenges That Can Derail Hypergrowth Start-Ups]]></title>
		<link>https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/five-challenges-that-can-derail-hypergrowth-start-ups/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[RHR has been engaged to advise on leadership and management challenges by venture capital (VC) firms and founders of companies that are engaged in rapid scaling. We have observed that the ability of many of these hypergrowth companies to scale rapidly can be compromised by two factors: (1) the developmental challenges inherent in first-time founders-CEOs and (2) the system inefficiencies inherent in prioritizing speed and growth over building corporate processes and structures.

Hypergrowth companies have periods of intense growth, which can manifest in doubling or even quadrupling quarter after quarter for several years. Rapid growth, often necessary to gain market scale, can be extremely disrupting to individual leaders, their coworkers, and company culture. We have observed that those founders-CEOs and companies that have successfully navigated these growth periods have consistently overcome <b>five unique challenges</b>.
<ol>
 	<li><b> Challenge: </b>First-time founders-CEOs differ significantly from CEOs who have been hired into previously sustainable companies (i.e., “traditional” CEOs). Traditional CEOs have been promoted and vetted through their career to be strong operators and have demonstrated leadership ambition. First-time founders-CEOs tend to be subject matter experts (SMEs), often in engineering, product, or design, with unusually high passion and drive for change, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Often the operational and leadership abilities of these founders-CEOs are deficient to the tasks of growing and leading beyond the requirements of a small company.</li>
</ol>
<b>&gt; Solution: </b>Founders-CEOs who have successfully navigated this challenge have acknowledged their operational deficiencies. They have responded by (1) focusing their operational responsibility on those operational areas where they have actual SME, for example in product, engineering, or design, and (2) have learned how to hire and trust proven leaders to lead in the other operational areas of the company. Hypergrowth companies’ potential success is highly dependent upon the founder-CEO exercising their vision, passion, and skills in their area of expertise and getting out of the way in the other areas of the company where they are unskilled.
<ol start="2">
 	<li><b> Challenge: </b>By the time a start-up has moved into hypergrowth, the senior team is made up of a cadre of battle-tested, highly trusted colleagues who have been with the founder since the beginning, along with accomplished, externally proven senior leaders who have been hired more recently. Many founders-CEOs are confronted with the challenge that some of their trusted colleagues from the early days are struggling with leading in a much larger company, and most founders-CEOs struggle with the emotional decision of removing them from their responsibilities. Many founders-CEOs also have difficulty deeply trusting the accomplished new hires because they haven’t bonded through the experience of surviving the difficult early years together.</li>
</ol>
<b>&gt; Solution: </b>Successful founders-CEOs have figured out the challenge of deciding between personal loyalty versus business interests in determining (1) who among their highly trusted early hires is able to scale and (2) who among the recently hired accomplished leaders can be trusted to be in it for the vision and mission, not just the financial opportunity.

<b>3.a. Challenge: </b>First-time founders-CEOs often are highly confident in their SME and are able to make decisions and move rapidly in their subject matter area. However, they often exhibit indecision in unfamiliar leadership arenas, and their indecisiveness becomes a bottleneck that slows down rapid growth.

<b>3.b. Challenge: </b>When founders-CEOs haven’t articulated clear decision-making processes, their senior teams also exhibit confusing and inefficient decision-making, which seriously inhibits execution speed.

<b>&gt; Solution: </b>Successful founders-CEOs have come to the realization that they need to define clear decision-making processes for themselves and their senior teams. They often institute different processes for those areas where they have SME and are confident versus areas where they don’t have expertise and confidence. Many founders-CEOs have implemented some type of decision or prioritization process, such as drive/partner/audit/ignore.
<ol start="4">
 	<li><b> Challenge: </b>Strong cultures that leverage company mission and values to motivate employees to excel and exceed expectations are necessary for rapid scaling. At some point in hypergrowth companies growing their workforce, founders-CEOs realize they can no longer ensure culture fit in new hires by personally interviewing all candidates. They must train and rely on the next layers down to intuitively know who will fit the culture.</li>
</ol>
<b>&gt; Solution: </b>Successful founders-CEOs realize that they must own the responsibility of maintaining culture through periods of hypergrowth by consciously and actively manifesting culture-consistent behaviors in all they do. They are authentic and transparent and frequently engage in town hall-style meetings to articulate and demonstrate behaviors consistent with the company culture.
<ol start="5">
 	<li><b> Challenge: </b>Hypergrowth companies build up “efficiency debt,” where rapidly scaling companies must prioritize product and go-to-market over business operations, and therefore, many necessary corporate structures and processes are undeveloped or seriously underdeveloped. Efficiency debt often results in “the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing,” with wasted effort, frustration, and a decrease in employee morale.</li>
</ol>
<b>&gt; Solution: </b>Successful hypergrowth companies recognize this efficiency debt and know they must periodically revisit these un(der)developed company capacities. They keep the efficiency debt top of mind and continually institute risk assessments and mitigation strategies until they reach enough scale that they can devote the necessary time and effort to build in the requisite organizational structures and processes.

We have seen some venture-backed start-up companies exit their founder-CEO because they failed to rise to these challenges. And we have seen other companies experience considerable delay in reaching scale—some to the point that their competitors have overtaken their initial market lead. Being a first-time founder-CEO is an unbelievably daunting experience; having the ability to recognize when they are stumbling, seek assistance, listen to feedback, and course-correct is a requirement for ultimate success.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[‘Tis the season when most boards are preparing to conduct their required annual evaluation. Recently, EY’s Center for Board Matters published a brief about how Fortune 100 companies are <a href="https://assets.ey.com/content/dam/ey-sites/ey-com/en_us/topics/cbm/ey-how-companies-are-evolving-board-evaluations-and-disclosures.pdf">evolving their board evaluations and disclosures</a>. The Society for Corporate Governance referenced the EY study in this week’s <i>Society Huddle,</i> reporting some interesting statistics on company practices in board evaluations and the disclosures on their evaluations to shareholders. For example, 92% of the boards among the Fortune 100 for whom proxy statements were available for 2019 (79 companies) provided board evaluation disclosures in their proxy statements. Furthermore, 39% of those same companies reported the inclusion of individual director self-evaluations in addition to full board and committee evaluations. That percentage represented a significant increase over the 2018 figure of 24%. Clearly, providing directors with individual feedback, or alternatively, <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/new-thinking-board-evaluations-give-directors-feed-forward?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=New%20Thinking%20on%20Board%20Evaluations%3A%20Give%20Directors%20Feed-Forward">feed-forward</a>, about how they are contributing is an emerging best practice.

In addition to survey and interview methods to gather input from directors on how the board and individuals are contributing, there is another group of stakeholders whose input can also be very useful to a board evaluation: <b>the members of the company’s management team who interface with the board. </b>While boards of directors have a primary duty to serve the interests of shareholders, an important stakeholder group with whom a board must work to deliver on that duty is the executive management team. Over the course of the year, directors are exposed to and interact with the CFO, CHRO, major business unit heads, and other C-suite leaders both in full board sessions and in committee work. The quality of those interactions is critical to a board’s ability to do its job and provide a great, mutual opportunity for directors and management team members to align and collaborate. Those contacts enable board members to get to know mission-critical talent and allow management team members to broaden their perspectives and development. Incorporating input from those members of management who interface with the board can be a valuable source of data and insight about board effectiveness.

The EY study of board evaluation practices in 2019 reported that 27% of Fortune 100 boards used or considered using an outside facilitator for their board evaluations. When RHR International works in partnership with boards to conduct evaluations, we routinely survey and interview selected members of the management team who interact with directors on the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">What is the value that this board needs to contribute to the enterprise’s success at this time, and how well is it delivering that value?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">How effectively are the committees you interact with executing against their charters?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Does the board focus at the right level to deliver strategic value and respect the boundary between governance and management?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Does our board demonstrate adequate depth of understanding of our company’s business, strategy, and competitive landscape to deliver high-impact value?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Are there areas of experience and expertise that our board could add to enhance its ability to advise and guide us?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Does the trust level and working relationships among board members and management permit fully candid and open dialogue inside and out of committee meetings, and does our CEO support open access and transparency?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What are the top strengths of your board and what are the board’s opportunities to maximize their contributions toward the success of the enterprise in the future?</li>
</ul>
Not only does the invitation to offer input delight the participants who are invited, but the answers to these questions often generate invaluable insights and suggestions to enhance board effectiveness. So as you prepare for your board’s next evaluation, consider including input from the management team on whom you and your shareholders depend to execute your mission, vision, and strategy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[There is no doubt that there is still much to be done in regards to increasing diversity within the workplace in general and especially within senior executive ranks. The dearth of African Americans in the uppermost corporate leadership roles is especially stark.

According to a U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission survey in 2011, African American executives made up only 2.8 percent of CEOs. This number is lowest among the four major ethnic groups (Asian, African American, Hispanic, and Caucasian) in the United States. The discrepancy becomes even bleaker when you consider that African Americans occupy approximately 10 percent of management, business, and financial occupations. In contrast, white executives made up 93 percent of the CEOs, which was over 20 percent greater than their percentage in the labor force. These numbers clearly indicate that African Americans are struggling to gain a foothold on the highest rungs of the corporate ladder, hitting their glass ceiling around the midmanagement level.

The purpose of this research study is to create a deeper understanding of the nuances inherent in the developmental journey of African Americans as they strive to attain positions in the C-suite as well as other senior executive roles.

In a series of in-depth qualitative interviews, RHR International asked a select group of African American executives (in vice president or higher roles within primarily Fortune 200 corporations or nonprofit organizations) how they developed the business knowledge, leadership skills, and organizational behaviors needed to advance and succeed as senior leaders within their organizations.

Their answers provide groundbreaking insights on many levels: (1) how they viewed themselves at the time, (2) their struggle to advance, (3) the organizational hurdles they overcame, (4) the internal and external support

they required to develop, and (5) the impact of the organization’s cultural climate on their ability to succeed. These five factors play critical roles in determining career success or derailment for minority executives. They also have significant implications for an organization’s ability to hire and retain high-performing executives of color.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Perspectives on executive coaches have changed dramatically over the last 20 years. The stigma of coaching as a last-ditch effort to save a derailing executive has given way to an acknowledgment of its role as an important element of the support system that increases the effectiveness of senior leaders. The resulting expansion in demand has brought with it an expansion in supply—though of varying degrees of relevance and effectiveness. The question becomes, then, how do you select an executive coach? How do you identify the best resource who will help you create practical, sustainable leadership changes with real business impact?

In this <i>Executive Insight</i>, we outline the skills and experiences—the core competencies—senior executives and HR professionals should look for when determining whether a management psychologist or consultant will add value to their organization’s bottom line, as well as the leadership capability and career path of individual executives.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[CEO changes are often associated with the exit of other senior-level executives due to disapproval of the incoming chief executive, loyalty to the old CEO, or changes to the brain trust the new CEO enacts upon succession. The increased ambiguity experienced during these times often leads to decreased leader and employee engagement and commitment to the organization. Failed CEO transitions are costly. Share prices can decline sharply in response to unplanned CEO turnover, let alone the considerable replacement costs. A well-planned transition program is critical to a smooth transfer of leadership, maintaining business momentum, and meeting stakeholder expectations.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Beyond fulfilling a compliance requirement, board evaluations can be a great tool for helping boards elevate the value they contribute to the organizations they govern. The process for conducting board evaluations usually involves a survey of directors with questions about a range of governance practices. In constructing RHR International’s Board Development Survey, we took this approach a step further as a complement to our interview-based method: we correlated items with board member ratings of key organizational performance dimensions such as market share, profitability, employee engagement, and quality of products and services.*

So which items correlated most highly with ratings of those key organizational performance dimensions? The answer: the ones pertaining to the partnership between the board and CEO. In particular, the items concerning CEO compensation, candid and open communication, and effective partnership built on trust had the strongest relationships with these performance outcomes. Here are the three most important things we found:
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>CEO Compensation:</b> When the board believes that CEO compensation is well aligned with shareholder interests, the organization is more likely to be rated by board members as higher in profitability (<i>r</i> =.40), quality of products and services (<i>r</i> = .34), and employee engagement (<i>r</i> = .33).</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Communication:</b> When the CEO communicates more candidly and openly with senior management and the board, the organization is more likely to be rated by directors to have stronger employee engagement (<i>r</i> = .26) and profitability (<i>r</i> = .25).</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Trust:</b> When CEO/board partnerships are fundamentally based on trust, the organization is more likely to be rated higher in profitability (<i>r</i> = .28) and employee engagement (<i>r</i> = .27).</li>
</ol>
This data confirms findings from board evaluations RHR has conducted for clients. At Mastercard, where the board and governance practices are best in class, the partnership between the CEO Ajay Banga and the board is rock-solid and characterized by a high degree of mutual trust. Dialogue in the boardroom is open and candid. The CEO and board chair have built a very strong working relationship that enables the company to benefit from the advice and counsel of a diverse, highly knowledgeable, and committed group of directors.

<i>When comparing the results of our Great Boards benchmark group (the top 25% of organizational performance ratings) to the bottom 25%, we found significant differences between those who responded either “agree” or ‘”strongly agree” on the following items:</i>

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1919" src="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Great-Boards-300x144.png" alt="" width="300" height="144" />

What are some of the implications of this research for business practice? First, knowing the level of scrutiny given to CEO pay practices, the board needs to be able to tie compensation to concrete and measurable outcomes that go beyond share price. For example, the scorecard we use in our CEO evaluation service includes metrics for financial performance, people and culture, strategic direction and innovation, reputation management, and personal leadership.

Effective communication is another important area of focus for productive CEO/board partnerships. It is critical to establish two-way communication channels to ensure that everyone is aligned with the overall business strategy. In many situations, the board is isolated from the business and serves mainly as an advisory body for the CEO. By opening up channels of communication between the board, CEO, and senior management, leaders in the business can benefit from the board’s expertise while the board can gain insight into the operational effectiveness of the organization. Similarly, the CEO can benefit from regular contact with the board chair and other board members to gather opinions and provide updates so that everyone is kept in the loop.

Fair compensation and regular communication can serve as building blocks for the most important aspect of CEO/board partnerships—trust. Trust takes a long time to build and can be dismantled in an instant. To build trusting relationships, both the CEO and board members have to be aligned in their interests, but more importantly, they have to behave in ways that are mutually beneficial. A CEO who controls the board is not maximizing an important resource. Similarly, the board members need to support the CEO by providing clear objectives, regular oversight, and helpful advice in ways that can be heard and adopted. Trust builds between a CEO and the board by working together over time to build a partnership that advances the business and drives financial success.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Executive assessment is a commonplace tool used by organizations to make informed decisions on hiring critical talent. There are many variations out there, but most established human capital consulting firms use a multimethod approach. That is, they use psychometric testing to gain insights on problem-solving capabilities and leadership style combined with a biographical interview and experience benchmarking if needed. This data provides insight on fit to role and should also identify developmental gaps and areas of focus for effective onboarding.

Organizations spend a lot of money mitigating the risk of hiring the wrong executive. However, our sense is that not all get the full value inherent in a strong executive assessment. The reality of fast-moving business life is that once a hiring manager or head of HR sees a positive-sounding report, they accelerate to make an offer, and shortly thereafter, a new executive joins and optimism generally abounds. But what happens to the nuanced insights and information embedded in that executive assessment? Too often reports gather dust because they are viewed as risk-mitigation tools rather than integration and developmental roadmaps or data inputs to begin building a coherent picture of organizational talent. So, what do best-in-class companies do with their executive assessments?
<h3>The starting point: Getting clear on the 30%</h3>
We all know that certain leadership traits are generically relevant across all industry contexts, functions, and verticals. For example, all strong leaders understand their weaknesses and how to compensate for them through others. We generally assume about 70% of effective leadership traits and behaviors are generalizable. The additional 30% is more specific to the cultural context of the organization and the lift required in the role (e.g., leading a transformation or turnaround). An effective executive assessment must factor in a leader’s fit to the cultural landscape in addition to the leader’s fluency in delivering the kind of impact needed (generally associated with previous track record, experience, and scope of roles). We also need to understand the plasticity of the leader—i.e., their degree of leadership agility and ability to shift and change to overcome new challenges. Best practice is taking the time (before an executive assessment takes place) to get clear on the 30%—the critical ingredients to success that are nuanced to a particular organizational context and culture. Without this, assessments risk being boilerplate and not addressing the most critical questions needed to understand fit.
<h3>Getting to the most critical information</h3>
I hear that busy hiring managers and HR professionals don’t have the time to read through a full executive assessment report these days and prefer a pithy summary. I fully appreciate the phenomenon of “my eyes glaze over,” or MEGO. The onus is on your assessment provider to ensure the most critical bullets are underlined and served up early . . . no argument. However, a verbal feedback to thread the needle and bring nuanced data to light is so important to getting the most from an executive assessment. The written word struggles to always paint a clear picture, connect multiple dots, and bring a person fully to life. Yet, many organizations are happy to just move on when they have their hands on a report, and a verbal feedback slips into the nice-to-have category. In my mind, a feedback to the hiring manager and head of HR is more critical than a static report. It is a chance to ask clarifying questions and, more importantly, to talk through implications for onboarding and leadership development. Ideally, it’s a planning meeting focused on setting up a new executive for success versus a data dump.
<h3>Playing insights forward</h3>
Building on the idea of an assessment debrief as a planning session, I have seen that organizations that leverage companies like RHR most effectively want to talk through myriad “what ifs” and want to get at potential leadership challenges before they become realities. They are turning assessment insights into robust onboarding plans that identify a game plan for well-known barriers to <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/sites/default/files/pdf_files/Executive%20Integration%20Stumbling%20to%20the%20Top.pdf">successful executive integration</a>: role clarity, relationship building and stakeholder management, navigating the culture, accelerating learning, and identifying early wins. They are inquiring into ways to accelerate performance, whether that be via an executive-coaching relationship or exposure to a part of the business that the executive needs but doesn’t currently have. Savvy hiring managers and HR professionals know that there are no perfect candidates out there. The key is to recognize leadership gaps and bridge them thoughtfully and quickly versus hoping they’ll fix themselves.
<h3>Integrating assessment data into talent systems</h3>
Every executive assessment provides an array of data insights with the individual as the unit of analysis. However, if leaders are assessed against a common set of criteria, a holistic view of talent strengths and gaps at the cohort level begins to build. Focusing training and development on shared leadership gaps, e.g., effective team development or change management, can help an organization pinpoint and accelerate talent capabilities in line with business strategy. In addition, building a database of leaders who have been assessed enables the organization to get much clearer on its talent pipeline and bench for succession-planning purposes. Each new executive assessment provides data to gauge upticks in leadership health and capability at different organizational levels and can help pinpoint assessment criteria for future hires. For example, recognizing that a critical group of general managers are great operational tacticians but are underdeveloped as strategy developers should weigh future hiring criteria and focus the leadership-development agenda.

Great companies leverage executive assessment as a tool beyond risk mitigation. They leverage the myriad data insights each assessment unit provides to focus leadership development, accelerate performance, and track the health and depth of your succession bench.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Witnessing some of the greatest athletes of all time perform at their very best late into their careers should give all of us pause. How do Roger Federer, Serena Williams, and LeBron James—each one achieving Greatest Of All Time (G.O.A.T.) status—maintain the stamina, mental focus, physical prowess, and passion for their sport well into their late 30s, when most others have retired their number and hung up their sneakers?

One important shift in how athletes train is the growing appreciation for the concept of oscillation: mastering how the mind and body oscillate between periods of stress and recovery to ensure peak performance. Simply note the popularity of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/watch/">Apple Watch</a> or biometric monitoring devices like <a href="https://www.whoop.com/">WHOOP</a> or <a href="https://ouraring.com/">Oura</a> that track your heart rate at all times and produce a “readiness” score on a daily basis. The research on injury reduction and sustained performance is certainly compelling, and in the professional sports world, translates into real dollars as more games are won because the best athletes are showing up in top form day in and day out. And could it be that sleeping 11–12 hours a night really makes a difference? LeBron and Federer both do that.

While professional athletes need to swing a racket or shoot a ball, executive leaders need to understand that every interaction with others and every decision made is their forehand and three-point shot. Their peak performance is when they can focus on each moment, are mentally present, and are emotionally centered.

Through RHR’s partnership with the <a href="https://jnjinstitute.com/?&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=jji+%7C+us-2019-branded%3BS%3BPH%3BBR%3BSUR%3BHCP%3BBR&amp;utm_content=General&amp;utm_term=%2Bjohnson+%2B%26+%2Bjohnson+%2Binstitute&amp;&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwkenqBRBgEiwA-bZVtrHYN3Lu_mix66O5wNg0KTnwjmoDviC55YURyMY0vVpGtUt4uHa3XxoCUkgQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Johnson &amp; Johnson Human Performance Institute®</a> (HPI), we help executives gain the knowledge they need to live into their purpose and develop the physical, emotional, and mental capabilities to lead at their best. And core to success is mastering oscillation. Our work with executive leaders and HPI’s research shows that excessive stress without adequate recovery eventually compromises our performance and our health. Neurologically, stress produces excessive cortisol, the hormone that can 1) make us less aware of our impact on others, 2) corrupt our planning and thinking abilities by too quickly narrowing the playing field, and 3) decrease our ability to manage our emotions, making others wary to challenge us because our fuse is so short. When leaders at the top of the power structure exhibit these behaviors, the consequences are substantive.

Creatively addressing the stress and recovery balancing act is an ongoing journey for all of us. To help on the road to mastering oscillation, here are practical suggestions to provoke further thinking and action.
<ol>
 	<li><b> Give yourself permission to rest and recover. </b>This is the most frequent barrier we encounter with high-achieving executives. Their keys to success have been predicated on a 24/7 work ethic—an “always on” mentality. It usually serves them well until it doesn’t. Reflect on your conscious and unconscious beliefs about work and rest and challenge faulty assumptions that associate rest with weakness.</li>
 	<li><b> Recovery is not for the weekends only. </b>Oscillation should occur during the day, every day. Senior executives are typically in performance mode 85% of the time, whereas professional athletes are about 20%. Given that grueling statistic, executives need to find moments of recovery during the work day. Review your week and experiment with scheduling 45-minute meetings instead of the default of one hour. Use that time to de-stress. Some of the most effective de-stressing techniques during the day are:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Deep breathing</i>. Five minutes of deep breathing can reset the autonomic nervous system especially after emotionally intense encounters or meetings.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Movement and nature.</i> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2018/07/10/forest-bathing-really-may-be-good-for-health-study-finds/amp/">Getting the metabolism up can help boost downturns during the day. Doing that in nature adds even more benefit given how sensitive our bodies are to it</a>. If possible, adding a few walking meetings (preferably in a forest) can have positive energizing effects.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Afternoon naps</i>. Yes I said that. <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/11/the-science-behind-why-you-should-have-a-nap/">Truth be told, Google’s napping pods are here to stay and are becoming a norm more than a curiosity.</a> Napping helps the brain take out the neurological “garbage” that accumulates during the day. Keep naps to 25 minutes to both sharpen thinking and avoid interrupting your nighttime sleep.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Gratitude practices.</i> <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/giving-thanks-can-make-you-happier">A recent study found that writing down what you are grateful for on a daily basis reduces anxiety and cortisol levels in the body.</a></li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><i>Meditation</i>. While the last five years have solidified meditation’s place in our wellness regime, new tools and apps are making it easier than ever to derive the benefits (<a href="https://www.calm.com/?utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=gsa_calm_desktop-xx_us-en_cpc_exact_trial&amp;utm_content=trial&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwkenqBRBgEiwA-bZVtkR1rNZ5bxCjR2zMu5CruOpsUNCpKDkfYmFz4_ZayFVVhRT3rKFYYhoCkfQQAvD_BwE">Calm</a>, <a href="https://www.heartmath.com/">HeartMath</a>, etc.). Brief periods of meditation can provide needed recovery during intense days filled with back-to-back meetings.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
 	<li><b> Customize your recovery moments to fit you. </b>Everyone has unique preferences for recovery. Learning to reset yourself in small moments—whatever that means to you—is what is most important. One executive we worked with was a big fan of heavy metal music and his car time was when he would use that to recover and recharge. Be creative and willing to experiment.</li>
</ol>
As executives seek to thrive in increasingly complex, fast-changing environments, mastering oscillation and the daily moment-to-moment balance of stress and recovery is no longer a “nice to have” but a necessity to perform at your best.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you are like me and are wondering how it only takes minutes for thirty-two people to die and fifty-one to be injured in two mass shootings in less than 24 hours, then you probably continue to be in shock over the state of violence in the United States. Personally, I avoided hearing or reading about the El Paso, Texas, mass shooting, knowing that the victims targeted were Latinx.. It was a reminder, once again, that people who look like me are not safe in this country. All of us are reeling from wanting to feel that there is a place for us and the strong sense that either who we are or the everyday activities that we participate in are constantly under threat.

I consider ignoring all of it, mostly so that I can continue to live my life rather than hiding in my home, in the hope that I may someday wake up and things will be different. Yet, we all lose if we don’t stay connected and we hide from the trauma and suffering of others just so that we can pretend to feel safe. I also struggle with my own sense of <i>What can I do that will make a difference? What can </i><i>we</i><i> do to make a difference?</i> Frankly, I think adding more fuel to the fire of divisiveness is not helping us change who we are. I know I will not be at my local politician's office trying to push legislation. That is not what I do best.

What I do best, and <i>what we do best</i>, is impact the lives of leaders; we change behavior. We create meaningful shifts in the lives of people who touch thousands of other people. We enable the leaders to see who they are and the stories they have created about where they and others belong. We look for points of connection such as values, purpose, and meaningful impact in order to create a deep sense of belonging across the organization. We challenge leaders to see alternatives to the actions they have chosen in the past and to choose differently. Our job is to continue to help them see the humanity of all of their employees and the need for their employees to feel they can trust the organizations they sit in—that in this place they are safe, they are heard, and they are seen. That is what we do.

This is how we make a difference.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>What makes a winning franchise?</b>

I’m a generic sport fan. I have my favorites but want you to continue reading so will keep my biases under wraps. Historically there have been certain teams that have been dominant dynasties. In between, upstarts land on the scene, have a great season, and potentially fade. Some teams have household names, others are built around up-and-comers or unknowns. Talent clearly makes a difference, but my sense is how that talent is organized around a set of critical enablers and behaviors is the bigger differentiator. They have a system that works. To see a top-tier football or basketball team work together, quickly align on the play, all understand their roles, and deliver is amazing to watch. I have no real clue what happens in those player huddles but when the play is called, it certainly looks like a well-oiled machine. At RHR, we get a chance to work with many organizations, many of whom are resource-rich and have strong leaders, but have operating challenges that contribute to execution shortfalls. Having collected themes across industries and with a view to exhausting as many sports analogies as we can, here’s our sense of what is amiss.

<b>Confused play calling—I’ve told you once!</b>

It is amazing how many plays are being called in organizations these days. Greater complexity and pressure to move at speed mean that communication happens haphazardly, in a rush, and with competing messaging. Leaders often can parrot the need to reinforce their important messages over and over but few seldom do so. They forget that people are inundated with requests and to-dos. If you want something done the right way, then make the time to message it the right way, underline it, repeat it, and reinforce it.

<b>The huddle—the never-beginning or never-ending meeting</b>

The football huddle is the most effective meeting in the history of meetings. A 15-second review of what is going to happen, where people need to be and…bang, it’s done. To generalize, in corporations, there are very few huddles occurring. Instead we’re faced with endless meetings, some without clear agendas, some without clear output or follow-up actions. How to productively get things done when one meeting begets another. Decisions limp forward until next week or better still, the week after when the head of sales is present. Really. Just throw the ball!

<b>Dropping the ball</b>

On the topic of balls, why is it that so many important to-dos don’t get to-done? I don’t see masses of incompetent people or laziness in businesses. I do see plenty of people who just have too much going on and are not humanly capable of delivering the mounting expectations that seem to be a recurrent side effect of living in a matrix system. Demands come from so many avenues with little appreciation of who else has thrown a ball. Checking in occasionally to understand what people have on their plates is key. Similarly, pushing back and speaking up when you’re buried might be hard in the short term but worth it in the long run.

<b>Complicated playbooks (aka too many priorities)</b>

Similar to too many balls being thrown at people simultaneously, is the disease of trying to chase too many priorities at the same time. Top teams have a straightforward playbook that people can pick up quickly and replicate; key plays that everyone is rallied around. As we sit in strategy sessions and hear senior teams try to whittle down 32 priorities for FY19 to 26, or try to group them into eight meta categories, each with four sub priorities, we can’t help but wonder if there is a collective mental-health issue at play. Thirty-two priorities are not getting done! Execution suffers when there is a complete lack of true focus and too many people are chasing too many things. What are the top three to five key plays?

<b>Lack of defense (aka… stepping over the trash)</b>

Great defenses win games, or so the adage goes. It’s no different in organizations. Lack of defense in the realm of execution is ignoring the issues, challenges or problems that recur. It’s getting frustrated when the ball gets dropped but blaming individuals versus looking at the problem systemically. We call it “stepping over the trash.” It’s so easy to blame sales, marketing, or operations versus owning the enterprise.

<b>Knowing your role (aka who’s on first?)</b>

The Abbot and Costello skit about who’s on first is a classic. It’s amazing how relevant it can be to corporations. With complex handoffs in a value-creation chain across numerous priorities, role clarity is under duress. Executional discipline readily slips through the cracks as one person believes the other has something covered. Lack of communication adds to the issue. Finger-pointing exacerbates it. And frustration plus confusion doesn’t make for great results. Great execution demands clarity on roles and responsibilities and a willingness to step into ambiguity to get clarity when it’s lacking.

<b>Just whack it (aka reactivity)</b>

Last but not least, swinging for the fences versus strategically bunting to get on first, then stealing second, etc., works some of the time but most people strike out. Too many execution challenges are rooted in a lack of coordinated action and impulsive decision making that has people running in circles and not touching the right bases. Sometimes the art of going slow to go fast is key. Back to the power of the huddle, execution is about coordinated action with a clear objective, crisp communication, and role clarity. That’s how you win games.

In summary, evaluate the following to execute effectively:
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1">Where are our communication gaps?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Is there clarity of ownership on tasks?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Are we stepping over the trash?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Are decisions clear?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Do we have priority overload?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Are people pushing back and challenging enough?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Are we reactive or strategic and proactive?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Are we huddling on the right issues?</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://collaborativity.ca/naomi-titleman-colla/">Naomi Titleman</a> is founder and principal of Collaborativity Leadership Advisory<a href="http://collaborativity.ca/">,</a> a Toronto-based consultancy focused on driving progressive talent strategy in this new world of work. She is an award-winning HR executive with laser focus on the employee and customer experience, and she partners with leaders who want to maximize business performance through progressive people strategies. She is one of Canada’s foremost thinkers on the future of work, and we wanted to check in with her on several related questions that our clients are asking.

RHR’s Guy Beaudin asks her some questions below:

<b>Guy: We hear much about the future of work. Much of it centers on the effects of technology. We don't hear as much about what this means in terms of the skills required to be successful in the digital economy. What is your perspective?</b>

<b>Naomi: </b>In order to be successful in this new world of work and not become irrelevant, there are three categories of skills that I believe are critical to develop:

1) Human or leadership skills: Many jobs will not completely disappear, but most will morph. Developing fungible, "human" skills will make you harder to automate and more valuable to organizations for two primary reasons:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">You are more able to work and lead across industries, functions, and roles</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Robots haven't yet mastered the art of empathy or persuasion; whether jobs or skills require eye contact is a good litmus test for likelihood of automation</li>
</ul>
2) Digital literacy skills: Digital literacy has become a fundamental skill as digitization is integrated into almost all jobs and functions. As automation gets smarter and takes on more tasks, we will need to up our game in skills such as curiosity, critical thinking, advanced analytics, user-centered design, mathematics, and statistics. As well, root causal analysis will become more and more important across functions and levels. Also, while not everyone will be expected to have coding skills, we will all need a basic level of digital literacy.

3) Tech skills: Evolve actively because your competition is no longer only fellow human full-time colleagues (say hello to Bot435 and the “crowd"). Stay curious and commit to lifelong learning and development. Jobs are changing and new job types (and university degrees and certificates) are emerging every day. For those interested in getting deeper into the tech world, coding is now a more attainable skill, not just for computer scientists … both because of the simplification of computer languages and also with the emergence of mainstream coding courses offered through companies such as <a href="https://www.hatch.com/">Hatch</a>.

<b>Guy: Even with all the changes occurring in the world of work, it seems that most of our clients are operating in a fixed paradigm of one role, one person on a full-time contract. What are you seeing in terms of alternative work arrangements and what benefits do you see them having, both for the individual and the employer?</b>

<b>Naomi:</b> Ah yes, thinking about the good old days when staffing was much simpler. Back then, the "personnel department" would gather some résumés, conduct a few interviews, hire the best full-time (human) employee and we would all get on with the job.

Now, thanks to the exponential acceleration of technology, there are countless ways to get work done. When considering "who" is the best candidate to complete a job, organizations are no longer restricted to full-time/part-time employees, contractors, and outsourced providers, but can now also engage the "gig economy," crowds, and automation—e.g., robotic process automation (RPA) and artificial intelligence (AI).

If you believe the statistics, 50% of workers will be part of the gig economy (where workers opt for projects or "gigs" over full-time employment) by 2020. Many are now choosing this way of working instead of a full-time role—which is a shift from the past where many members of the gig economy were working that way temporarily while in transition/searching for their next full-time role. I, for one, choose to be a “gigger” instead of a full-time employee as I enjoy the variety of projects, companies, and leadership teams on/with whom I get to work. It also provides me with the flexibility I desire while raising a young family. I choose my projects based on the strategic impact I can make on an organization, which is independent of my employment relationship.

Freelancers, or “giggers,” as I like to call them, can be excellent candidates for short-term, time-boxed, well-defined projects. Hiring giggers can bring additional horsepower and infuse diverse thinking into a project or team. It is also a great way to keep retirees and their invaluable knowledge in the organization in a more flexible way...and access talent that has been sidelined due to mobility or schedule constraints. Companies that don’t consider the gig economy as a strategic segment of their workforce risk losing out on some highly skilled and talented workers.

<b>Guy: It is common for our clients to seek change agents to help spur innovation and creativity in their ranks, yet many of these hires end up not being successful—oftentimes for being the very disruptors that the company said they needed. What can employers do to help increase their success rate in hiring and retaining disruptive thinkers?</b>

<b>Naomi:</b> I’ll pull up a <a href="https://www.nba.com/raptors/">Raptors</a> analogy for this one. Kawhi Leonard and Marc Gasol were both brought in to the Raptors franchise for deliberate reasons. They each have unique skills believed to improve the odds of the team going all the way. And it worked. However, bringing in disruptive talent—whether giggers or full-time/permanent—comes with risk. For talent to thrive, and not experience “organ rejection,” thoughtful onboarding, including cultural assimilation and a commitment to inclusion, is a must. Otherwise, seemingly star “athletes” hired into organizations to spark innovation cannot do so because of the environment they are brought into or are not adequately prepared for. Onboarding does not stop at day 30, 60, or 90—especially in organizations that tend to employ a lot of “lifers,” which often breeds a very distinct culture. Disruptive talent needs ongoing support to navigate the politics and relationships that inevitably exist in most if not all organizations. Companies need to be mindful about connecting these employees to the right mentors and coaches and also need to have the courage to eliminate roadblocks that could stand in the way of innovation.

<b><i>Guy: Thank you for this, Naomi. Informative and thought-provoking as usual. </i></b>

		<title><![CDATA[Evaluating Your Board: Seven Areas to Assess]]></title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Conducting an annual evaluation of the board is a requirement of all public listed companies on the New York Stock Exchange and is a strongly encouraged best practice in governance by regulatory bodies throughout the world. The most conscientious and progressive board leaders have moved well beyond a simple check-the-box compliance approach to a more rigorous process that is aimed at identifying ways the board can continually enhance the contribution it makes to the organization it is governing. Additionally, many boards are embracing the best-practice recommendation of using an outside facilitator every two to three years to ensure an objective and comprehensive process.

Much has been written and is readily accessible on the Internet about how boards can conduct a proper evaluation. Despite the available guidance, a joint study conducted by RHR International and NYSE Governance Services called <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/sites/default/files/pdf_files/Sustaining_Boardroom_Performance_How_Great_Boards_Stay_Great.pdf"><i>Sustaining Boardroom Performance: How Great Boards Stay Great</i></a>, found that only 46% of the 620 directors surveyed reported their board’s evaluation process was very effective. To assist boards in doing evaluations that are effective in identifying opportunities to improve their effectiveness, we engaged in a broad review of evaluation practices and developed an approach that combines survey and interview methodologies to address seven important areas of board functioning. Whether you use an outside facilitator or not, below are seven areas to include in your board evaluation and a key question to answer in each area.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-1943 size-full" src="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/board-eval.jpg" alt="" width="676" height="327" />

<b>How to Proceed</b>

The steps in setting up a best-practice board evaluation are outlined in <a href="#"><i>How to Conduct a Proper Board Evaluation</i></a><i>.</i>  A thorough board evaluation should address each of the seven governance dimensions and the key questions above through a combination of survey items (which enable year-over-year comparisons) and confidential interviews with each board member. Input from members of the management team who have exposure to the board can also be valuable in assessing board and committee effectiveness. In addition to these seven dimensions, a good board evaluation can also include specific topics that are relevant to the unique context of the company. Confidentiality is very critical to a proper board evaluation in order to maximize candor and the best data.

An emerging best practice in board evaluation is the inclusion of individual director feedback so that each board member can receive constructive input about how they can maximize their contributions as a director in the future. In the NYSE/RHR study referenced above, 90% of directors said that they would want to receive feedback about their individual performance as a director but only 39% of them reported that they received that feedback.

By addressing each of these seven areas with a focus on how improvement can be made in full board, committee, and individual director effectiveness, boards can ensure that their impact and influence on the organization they are charged with guiding helps the enterprise succeed in the performance of its mission and objectives.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By the time most executives reach the C-suite, they have received dozens of performance reviews and undergone at least a handful of 360-degree feedback processes. Over the years, as each of these review or feedback documents has been handed to them, they’ve gotten into the habit of skimming the first page, flipping past the “Strengths” section, and obsessing unhealthily over the comments in the section titled “Opportunities” or “Challenges.”

This is because the model of “Strengths” and “Challenges” treats leadership performance as a set of fixed attributes, aspects of yourself that you should feel either good or bad about. Spend time on your strengths, and you’re patting yourself on the back. Spend time on your challenges, and you end up demotivated by viewing yourself as someone with evident character flaws.

We propose instead a model in which your performance as a leader is grounded in your “default settings.” Like any electronic device or piece of hardware that you buy, people come with factory-installed default settings. These settings render some skills easy to perform and others more difficult. Successful executives have leaned in, maximizing the skills that come to them naturally and creating a virtuous cycle of performance and practice. They’ve found ways to avoid the less-inherent tasks or the settings that call for them.

Leaders who view strengths and challenges as attributes, risk paying insufficient attention to the implications of their default settings. We all have things that come to us easily. Failing to realize that you are more fluid than others in a certain skill or practice will lead you to view yourself as “average” and others as “subpar.” As a result, you may underestimate the degree to which you need to reverse engineer what you do and teach it to others. You are also likely to hold unrealistic expectations, with an unachievably high bar for others’ performance and speed. You will do your team a disservice by perennially viewing them as subpar in these areas, while failing to offer them the time and guidance that they need to become more fluid in the skills.

Similarly, framing other default settings as deficits or flaws diminishes your ability to feel valuable or worthy. It is de-energizing to think, “there’s something wrong with me.” If instead you recognize that your defaults render some skills more challenging, you now have alternatives. We suggest that you have three options for addressing skills that do not come to you easily. The first option is to acknowledge that this is not a natural talent of yours. You will show up as human and relatable when you proactively tell others, “I wish I was better at doing this, but it’s never come easily to me. Please help me if you see me struggling.” An example might be someone who is working on being concise and focused when speaking to a group. The second option is for skills that are important but would take a great deal of time and effort to develop personally. Those can be outsourced to someone for whom the task comes easily. An example would be a creative leader who depends on her chief of staff to keep her organized and on track. The third option is for those few areas that you must try to improve, even though you may never excel at them. An example would be offering words of encouragement and gratitude to the team that works for you. Even if you will never be fully fluid at doing this, it is something that cannot be outsourced or allowed to slide, so leveraging tools and reminders are necessary.

The good news is that like hardware settings, human defaults can be adjusted. Doing so takes some tinkering. You’ll need to understand how the defaults work, and you may need to develop some new habits. Just as engineers can install software on top of the hardware to adapt a user interface or output, people can build mindfulness, practices, and habits that enable them to become more fluid in areas that did not initially come to them naturally. For both hardware and people, it is critical to remember that adding software uses extra power, and the device or person will need extra time to recharge. The payoff that comes from understanding and addressing your defaults is that you will increase your flexibility and agility, becoming more effective and more applicable across a wider variety of settings.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Are there specific aspects of a board chair role that, if demonstrated at a very high level, are most likely to make the difference between a good board and a great one? Through our ongoing work with boards, we have found that the answer is yes. There are two board leader characteristics that significantly increase the likelihood that a board is maximizing its potential value to the organization. For the purpose of this discussion, we will be focusing on instances where the board chair and CEO roles are separate.

The first is the board chair’s ability to establish a very high and consistent level of trust between themselves and the other directors. To be clear, we are not referring to scenarios where the board chair is not trusted. Obviously, a lack of trust in a leader creates a whole host of potential issues. We are specifically focusing on the differential impact created by the existence of a resounding level of trust in the board leader versus a solid, substantial level.

Results from our analysis on data captured as part of RHR’s Board Development Survey* indicate that board members who feel strongly that their board chair is trusted by other directors[1] were significantly more likely to be serving on a board that is operating at the highest levels in multiple areas vital in today’s challenging environment. In short, they were more likely to be at the helm of a great board.

When there is a high level of trust in the board chair, directors are significantly more likely to also trust one another, both admiring and relying on their peers’ abilities and integrity. Not surprisingly, these boards are also more likely to operate with a high degree of independence from management. Under the board chair’s leadership, these boards tend to have full, open, and candid conversations with the CEO and senior management. There is less emphasis on managing the messages and more investment in challenging assumptions and leveraging the perspectives in the room to arrive at better decisions[2]<b>.</b>

The main commonality among many of the areas of board functioning that are differentially impacted by having a high trust in the board chair is that they involve interpersonal risk. When board chairs establish the highest levels of trust with their fellow directors, they create an environment that reduces these perceived risks and where important but difficult conversations proactively take place—ones that maximize the board’s and the company’s ability to perform.

On boards with a highly trusted leader, new directors are expected and encouraged to fully contribute to the board immediately. This is particularly important given that the current focus on bringing emerging skills and expertise to boards has also yielded a trend where approximately half of new directors are first-time board members. On the flip side, these are also the boards that are very effective at the challenging task of retiring directors who are not contributing as expected. With the rapid evolution of the business landscape, the opportunity cost to the board and the organization of an underperforming or less-relevant director continues to increase, yet human dynamics tend to delay these conversations[3]<b>.</b>

The highest levels of trust come from a board chair who, among other actions, addresses conflicts, in all of its forms, in a proactive, candid, and balanced manner; consistently invests time with directors to understand them as individuals, including their perspectives, values, and strengths; takes interpersonal risks to ensure authenticity; and is as explicit, proactive, and consistent as possible regarding expectations. Trust is also increased by thoroughly embracing the chair’s roles as orchestra conductor, galvanizer, and culture steward versus imposing decisions or solutions based on his or her own expertise or experience. The latter approach is more likely to be demonstrated by those new to the role of chair or those who have had this role on the same board for an extended period of time, making them vulnerable to a tendency to become somewhat tone deaf in their role as orchestra leader.

There are many effective, basically well-functioning boards out there. However, with the number and pace of challenging external trends impacting businesses, the difference between a good board and a great one may prove to be a competitive advantage within the board chair’s control to help create.

In <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/becoming-great-board-chair-part-ii">part two</a> of this series we will cover the second factor that significantly increases the likelihood of a high-functioning board: a chairperson who actively and routinely seeks and uses feedback about their effectiveness in the role.

&nbsp;

*RHR’s Board Development Survey, designed to assist boards in identifying opportunities to improve their effectiveness, consists of 55 items across <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/evaluating-your-board-seven-areas-assess"><b>seven dimensions of governance</b></a><b>. </b>The original database was compiled from the responses of directors who collectively serve on 120 boards of mid-cap and large-cap companies. Our research shows that the strongest boards have strong chair leadership, healthy board dynamics characterized by candid debate, and a shared understanding of the organization’s financial, regulatory, and operational risk-tolerance levels.

For the full survey results, please contact kgilson@rhrinternational.com.

<b>[1] </b>As indicated by selecting that they strongly agree that their board chair is trusted by other directors.

<b>[2] </b>The correlations between the behaviors in this section and trust in the board chair were all positive and significant, ranging from r = .38 to .45.

<b>[3] </b>The correlations between the behaviors in this section and trust in the board chair were all positive and significant, averaging r = .47.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As companies continue to navigate the evolving challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen our clients shift from crisis mode to planning for a <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/the-new-normal-is-now/">new normal</a> and what the journey ahead might look like. Although this is causing some companies to delay executing succession plans that had been in place in an attempt to provide stability and continuity in what is already a time of constant change, others are choosing to capitalize on this change and accelerate plans by hiring or promoting new leaders who bring different skillsets for addressing the challenges ahead. Regardless of whether a promotion or hiring decision had been made prior to or during the time of social distancing, newly hired executives are stepping into new—ofttimes larger—leadership roles under unfamiliar circumstances. They are immediately being challenged to evolve beyond the skills that got them the role to begin with as they integrate into a new environment or lead new teams without the luxury of face-to-face interactions.

Over the years, <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Executive-Selection-and-Integration_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our research on newly selected leaders</a> has informed the five critical success factors to which we draw their attention. Although the environments in which leaders are operating and the tools necessary to create these outcomes have shifted, the importance of pursuing these five goals still holds true today. We suggest the following tactics for newly selected or promoted leaders facing the tough challenge of establishing credibility in these unprecedented circumstances.

<b>Role clarity. </b>The current environment of constantly shifting market dynamics and priorities is creating challenges for even the most tenured of leaders in today’s companies. While they have experience and historical context on their side, new leaders are facing similar situations without the same foundation to build on. With this in mind, it is more critical than ever for HR business partners and managers to provide clear expectations around what success looks like for new leaders early in their roles. Creating one or two key areas of focus will provide direction while also alleviating anxiety related to whether or not a new leader is meeting expectations.

<b>Relationships. </b>Although finding time for additional meetings or conversations has always been a struggle for senior leaders, many are finding the demands of their current virtual environments even more challenging. What was once a five-minute recap with key stakeholders in the hallway after a meeting is now another call and another block of time on an already full calendar. To allow new leaders the time they need to spend talking with and getting to know their most critical stakeholders, it is still important that these discussions are prioritized, but companies should also consider other ways to accelerate this aspect of integration. Joining small group conversations with key stakeholders, even outside of the new leader’s area of responsibility, can help them get into the flow of discussions early and often.

<b>Culture. </b>Over the course of their careers, many senior leaders become expert at reading the room and leveraging their interpersonal skills to adjust their approach to be successful in different environments. Learning “how things are done around here” is a necessary precursor to building good relationships and making effective decisions. The temporary shift from in-person to virtual meetings and interactions creates new challenges, though, as picking up on social cues is much more difficult via phone and video. To overcome this, organizations should consider being more explicit about their culture when onboarding new leaders. Taking the time to explain the norms and values and how work gets done can provide these leaders with a framework to better interpret what they are seeing and learning in their early days on the job. This has the added benefit of carving out space for the team to ask themselves whether their cultural norms and underpinnings are having the desired effect during current conditions. A robust discussion of “What are our norms, and are they helping or hindering us right now?” can be as valuable to the team as it is to the team’s newest member.

<b>Early wins. </b>The ability to achieve early wins is critical for both helping new leaders build credibility across the organization and for building confidence that they are contributing to important organizational outcomes. With fewer immediate inputs available for identifying areas where they can contribute, leaders are also facing challenges in identifying ways to build momentum early in their roles. This is another area where managers can help by creating opportunities to leverage the strengths they see in new leaders (many of which are the reasons they were hired in the first place) to contribute to meaningful outcomes. Leading initiatives or playing critical roles on important projects can accelerate the development of both credibility and confidence in new leaders.

<b>Accelerated learning.</b> When new to roles or organizations, executive learning takes on a variety of forms. Although there are sometimes technical skills that can be learned, leaders are often hired or promoted based on these, and the real learning occurs within the context of their new position. As is the case in our other areas of focus, the opportunity to learn through interactions and experiences has been decreased by the current pandemic. To overcome this, organizations should consider new ways to facilitate this same learning. Providing access to important documents and explicitly creating support systems made up of key stakeholders who can both monitor and contribute to the progress of necessary learning are a couple of ways to ensure this is achieved.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As many of us look at how businesses can survive during this pandemic-induced business slowdown (or shutdown for many), it should be obvious that <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-founder/">leadership is more important than ever</a>. The leadership choices being made today will have profound and long-term impacts not only on the business, but on employee engagement and loyalty. Most leaders will be thinking about the defensive moves that they need to make to protect their businesses. A few will be thinking about opportunities that may provide chances to grow or redirect their market positioning. Some will think about HR policy and engagement strategies for their employees, but few may be thinking about people development during this time. However, developing talent in this changing business climate is critical to sustaining the business and growing it post-crisis.

There isn’t just one area that leaders need to focus on to facilitate development. From a people-development standpoint, most leaders and organizations have organizational tools to aid with tutoring, training, and coaching activities. As such, this won’t be the focus of discussion here. Instead, the focus will be on cultivating thinking, creativity, and innovation skills.

First, leaders must <i>challenge</i>. They should challenge existing paradigms that those they lead may have around thinking and solving problems. To some degree, leaders should push people to think outside the box, but that in and of itself is too simplistic for development. They should be questioning, pushing, and at times cajoling, and even storytelling. All in the pursuit of creating known pathways of thinking to connect the dots and create ideas. Failure for the leader in this instance is not going far enough to create the dynamic and desire for thinking, creativity, and innovation.

Second, leaders <i>shape</i> the environment for thinking<i>.</i> Specifically, the leader must start with a clear statement of the current situation, the problem to be solved, and the goal. Situations and problems may change, but what will remain constant is the process leaders use to set the conditions for cultivating thinking and skill development. The statement of the current situation allows the leader to put the current “known universe” on the table. In a sporting analogy, this might be the broad game plan to defeat your opponent, including their strengths, weaknesses, and tendencies. Explaining the goal is important, as it has implications for how one might attack the problem or craft a solution.

There is a scene in the film <i>Hidden Figures</i> that exemplifies the concept. Kevin Costner’s character is discussing with his NASA engineering team what they have to do to find the math necessary to do the calculations to get the John Glenn Friendship 7 spacecraft back to earth. He doesn’t have the solution himself, but he throws out the idea that they are looking at the problem in the wrong way. He says, “Maybe this isn’t new math at all.” The heroine of the film, Katherine Johnson, picks up on it, saying yes, maybe it is old math, and she comes up with the idea of using Euler’s method to solve the equation. The group quickly gains consensus that this could work and sets off to do the calculations, which eventually leads to the solution.

Third, the actions leaders take should be <i>contextual.</i> The action steps deployed will vary by situation and the baseline skills of each individual being developed. A leader’s expertise on the topic or in this process isn’t a necessity. In fact, if a team believes the leader has all the answers, it may inhibit learning and ownership as individuals may not take risks or push themselves. Most importantly in this process, leaders should not provide the answers to the problem or stipulate the methodology for idea creation. Contextual action planning moves learning and development from being something passively done by individuals to a self-owned and directed journey toward process mastery (i.e., how to think through a situation, gain insights, and draw conclusions). Within this framework, individuals can develop ideas, implement them, and even fail in pursuit of skill development. To solidify learning, leaders must not settle for just getting the answers that solve the problem. Instead, they need to push individuals to detail how they got to the answers. This is the real developmental outgrowth of the exercise because it helps to explicitly identify and reinforce the tools and processes that enabled creativity and innovation to occur.

For leaders who choose to take on this developmental challenge, a few thoughts on best practices might be useful:
<ol>
 	<li>Set the conditions for development. Establishing the intervention can be done in an individual or group setting depending upon how the leader wants to address developmental opportunities in the team.</li>
 	<li>Don’t let perfection get in the way of good. Leaders do not need to be experts of the process or in the problem area being discussed. Instead, they need to be intentional in challenging, shaping, and contextualizing.</li>
 	<li>Lay out the problem to be addressed, provide foundational knowledge and information on the problem, and articulate the goal to be achieved.</li>
 	<li>Prohibit answers in the moment. Have the team go away and think about the problem before bringing solutions or ideas to the table. Ensure that sufficient time is given for thinking and idea development.</li>
 	<li>When presented with ideas or solutions, have the individuals walk you through not just the ideas, but the process they used for developing it.</li>
 	<li>Where necessary, help the individual delineate the process that you heard them use to get to their ideas.</li>
 	<li>Provide support and reinforcement for utilizing their process and challenge the team to think about how they could make the process better and even more effective.</li>
</ol>
Leaders who engage in this process will know they have achieved their goal by the output they see in the thinking and idea creation process of the individuals in their team. In addition, greater individual ownership, engagement, and proactive behavior should occur. As a result, leaders will see more unique, unconventional, and even creative ideas coming to the table.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Twentieth century leadership was characterized by the heroic, brilliant individual leaders who led countries and people out of wars and into prosperity. Twenty-first century leaders are those who can quickly pull together other great minds to solve complex problems. One of the reasons the federal government of the United States is struggling to respond to COVID-19 is because it is set up to implement policy, not to solve complex problems. An ideal response at the federal level would have been to pull together a global pandemic team of experts (scientists, healthcare experts, CEOs, mental health experts, and governors) and generate coordinated guidelines. Instead, we pulled back into factions and silos and failed to see the interconnected solutions required to respond effectively.

<a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-founder/">CEOs and business leaders</a> in global companies are more prepared as they are used to pulling together teams to address complex problems, but even their boundaries are being stretched in ways they had not imagined. For example, we are seeing pharmaceutical companies share science in order to combat COVID-19. They are less worried about who gets the credit and more interested in fighting a common enemy — a virus. Similarly, we are seeing medical device companies open source their intellectual property so others can manufacture ventilators. We are also seeing CEOs reach out across industries seeking input on how to navigate without knowing what is coming next. What we are witnessing is the emergence of twenty-first century leadership that is characterized by collective problem-solving, empathy, and the ability to mobilize quickly to neutralize threats to human populations on a global scale.

Twenty-first century problems will transcend national, state, or political identity as well as industry competition. We should all be observing what has changed and ask ourselves what is required of us as people, as leaders, and as citizens in order to thrive moving forward. The patterns are clear; we are globally connected and are extremely vulnerable. We can create great instability and/or wipe out huge swaths of the human population when we ignore the implications. Conversely, there is a bright side. We are globally connected and we have the tools to bring all of human ingenuity and brilliance to bear to thrive in new and unique ways. The challenge is to eradicate old mindsets and embrace new solutions. To start, let’s identify and support the coalition builders who are not afraid of complex problems but enjoy them. They know how to identify the root cause of problems, pull together experts, communicate a plan to broader populations, and mobilize a quick response. Maybe we just start there.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As we enter a middle phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, our clients are rapidly moving from shock and crisis to thinking about a world that will be changed for the foreseeable future. There is a good reason to do so. As much of the industrialized world remains in quarantine, we are all changing the way that we work and live in real time. These changes will lead to new, adaptive, and resilient behavior patterns that are likely to drive profound shifts in economic activity and value. Our clients are already anticipating the leadership actions that they will take as they guide their organizations back to “full opening” in this new normal.

<img class="wp-image-1752 aligncenter" src="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/chart-300x72.png" alt="" width="546" height="131" />

While we know that consumer behavior and buying patterns are shifting in response to unprecedented conditions, this event is of such magnitude, duration, and impact that some may never shift back to where they previously were. Different industries are experiencing different amounts and degrees of change; some have clarity on what the future holds, while for others, the stress of change is compounded by an unprecedented lack of business visibility. We find utility in understanding the current economy—and our clients—through a taxonomy of three general business scenarios:
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Crisis mode.</b> Those facing existential crises include travel/entertainment, retailers with smaller online presence, transportation, and oil and gas—among others. Many have little flex in their business models and no slack in their balance sheets.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Weathering the storm and planning for an uncertain future.</b> This category is the most common right now. Industries such as financial services represent this middle group, as do those whose core product or service will endure despite sea changes in modes of delivery or distribution. Leaders here are shifting moment-to-moment, recalibrating their focus as they respond to a crisis, deliver a strategic perspective to key stakeholders, and then help the team implement a new business model. Actions that previously did not occur the same day may now take place within the same hour.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Capitalize on the “now.”</b> Some are positioned to benefit from this crisis (think CPG food and videoconferencing as clear examples). These clients are in rapid growth, and in some ways seem like our clients who are in a crisis since they are marshaling all of their forces to deliver on today.</li>
</ol>
We encounter the first and the third categories in a “normal” economy. Many of our clients are skilled at capitalizing on opportunities; some have grown more adept at leading through crises than they would have preferred. In this new normal, weathering the storm is the scenario that brings new levels of volatility, requiring continual adaptation on the fly. Amidst this ongoing and high rate of change, our clients must build themselves a quiver of many options and an ambidextrous agility as they adjust in real time to lead the business, their people and teams, and themselves.

Our guidelines to help leaders navigate this period encompass all three of these aspects. To weather the storm and plan for an uncertain future, leaders must first ensure that they have what they need as human beings: energy, perspective, and flexibility. With this grounding, they can be emotionally available to their teams, understanding their needs and capitalizing on their diversity. This in turn affords the team the space to be innovative in leveraging the organization’s capabilities and building on them in new ways.
<h2><b>Leading self: Train like a marathon runner and practice emotional flexibility </b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h3>Train like a marathon runner</h3>
This time is a sprinting marathon; but you need the mindset of a long-distance runner. We are in month one of a three- to four-month training session, and we are entering the hardest part of our training. Knowing that this intense period will end is helpful so that you can sustain your intensity. Getting up every day and putting in your miles is a good metaphor to have in your mind. Taking care of nutritional needs is the most important aspect since sleep will be less available. Get creative with your short moments of recovery to ensure you still get the necessary amount to stay both focused and creative.
<h3>Practice emotional flexibility</h3>
Going from a crisis-planning mode to scenario-planning mode requires leaders to calm their minds and bodies down so that they can think clearly and creatively and engage their people with intentional impact. We know from brain research that humans cannot go from a crisis or “flight fight” mode to a creative/high-performing mode without first going to a recovery mode. And leaders need to be even more self-aware about when they need to shift their physiological states since they are traversing between modes with great frequency. Recovery practices (<a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/mastering-oscillation-how-peak-performance-in-sports-and-business-are-related/">Mastering Oscillation: How Peak Performance in Sports and Business Are Related</a>) have never been more important and need to be employed with greater frequency. Setting reminders before every meeting to consider a brief recovery moment (e.g., deep breathing to calm the autonomic nervous system) can help. Planning crisis meetings in the morning and creative brainstorming meetings in the afternoon can also help match thinking demands with the hormonal flow of cortisol and melatonin, the former to be employed for focusing and the latter for more expansive thinking.
<h2><b>Leading people: Understand human needs and leverage diversity</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h3>Understand the human need for sense-making</h3>
Almost all of us are working through a process called sensemaking. Technologists who study intelligent systems (<a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MakingSenseofSensemaking1-AlternativePerspectives.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reference</a>) define it this way:

"Sensemaking is a motivated, continuous effort to understand connections (which can be among people, places, and events) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively."

As humans, we need a mental model or framework within which to fit new data points. Without this framework, we feel anxious, and we suffer information overload. Our most important activities as humans depend upon us having a framework that tells us what data to pay attention to, how to draw conclusions, and what to do about the implications of those conclusions.

Sensemaking—the work of developing those frameworks—takes a lot of effort. Team members may seem distracted or overwhelmed as they try to figure out what's going on and what to do about it. The role of the leader, now more than ever, is to focus the enterprise on a very few values, priorities, and objectives. Leaders who meet their people’s human needs in times of uncertainty are those who provide structures and guideposts that enable people to simplify complexity and feel in control rather than overwhelmed by ambiguity. In parallel, they give people space and permission to sort through the meaning and implications of everything unprecedented.
<h3>Use your <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">diversity</a> at the right time and place</h3>
How to use your team as a leader has never been more important. For short-term crisis response planning and thinking, consider a smaller group of advisors (three to four) who are more like you than different. Bring in your divergent thinkers as you get close to considering implications for execution. The rationale for this is that you need to move fast and perfect cannot be the enemy of good since time is of the essence.

For the scenario planning, creative/innovative sessions, the opposite is true. Create slightly larger groups (seven to eight) with diverse thinkers at the table. Spend more time framing the issues and analyzing strategic options (<a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/intentionality-and-decision-making-in-the-senior-team/">Intentionality and Decision Making in the Senior Team</a>). Create smaller forums of your best operational people as you get close to making a strategic call to pressure test execution risk.
<h2><b>Leading business: Unpack your strategic advantage and get the full value out of your battlefield innovations</b></h2>
&nbsp;
<h3>Unpack your strategic advantage</h3>
Companies are a collection of capabilities. Organizations have deployed those capabilities in certain ways up until this moment; they now have the opportunity to understand new and innovative ways in which to create value with those same capabilities. All of us now are rising to the occasion as we encounter unprecedented needs at individual, group, and societal levels. Production lines that previously manufactured or assembled non-medical machinery or parts are now leveraged to create PPE, ventilators, and other frontline necessities. Teams who previously collaborated on meeting demand through brick-and-mortar retail outlets have mapped online demand to distribution network fulfillment in record times. As team members are furloughed, those remaining figure out how to solve problems and communicate in ways they had never envisioned.

The role of the leader now is to drive that unpacking to unleash the creativity of the organization by distilling its capabilities to their essence and asking, “What else could we do with these skills? What new needs can we meet by deploying our resources in different ways?”
<h3>Get the value of your battlefield innovations</h3>
Real-time innovations result in solutions that may endure for the short-term only. Temporary fixes with duct tape and good intentions get us through the hurricane, but are not built for the long run. What does have enduring value is the human capabilities that are established through these experiences of rising to the occasion. Leaders who have the future of the business in mind at all times will guide their teams to ensure that this value is captured and leveraged. For every solution that is generated during these stormy times, deputize a team member to write down three aspects of the situation: What unprecedented or challenging thing did we do? What were the capabilities that we displayed in order to do it? How, in more stable times, will we want to continue to leverage that organizational capability? This approach empowers the team in the future. Creating a track record like this will allow people to feel pride in their above-and-beyond achievements when there is once again room to pause and celebrate one another. It also enables the team to plan collaboratively around the new or evolved capabilities that strengthen the organization’s strategic advantage in the future.

These times test us as business leaders, as nation states, as communities, and as individuals. And these are also the moments where the intensity and demand of the challenge creates the environment for us to embrace our most creative and resilient selves.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The best boards are composed of a <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">diverse group of committed directors</a> who all bring experience, insights and high value relevant to the business of the organization they govern. When nominating and governance committee chairs select new directors to serve on boards, it is usually done after thoughtful consideration, using a skills-matrix approach, of what knowledge and capabilities the board needs to provide proper guidance and oversight. However, as the business context and operating landscape within which companies function are constantly changing, often at a very fast pace, the know-how and skills of directors don’t always keep up with those changes. In a <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Sustaining_Boardroom_Performance_How_Great_Boards_Stay_Great.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 survey of 620 directors who collectively served on more than 1,000 boards</a>, two-thirds of those who responded reported that the value they were expected to contribute had changed over the course of their tenure. For those who served on boards for more than five years, that percentage jumps to 88%. The potential gap between the knowledge and skills of incumbent directors and the knowledge and skills of what the current operating context requires of directors presents a significant challenge.

One important way in which that gap can be addressed is through robust director-education efforts. Despite this need, 73% of the directors we surveyed reported that the boards they serve on have no mandatory continuing-education requirement for directors. Another way is to replace directors who may have been a good fit against governance needs in the past but who no longer fit the desired criteria. Interestingly, almost all the directors who responded (99%) said they would want to know if their colleagues thought it was time for them to retire from the board, and one-third further acknowledged that there were directors on their boards who should be replaced so the board could be replenished with new skills and expertise. However, doing this is not easy. The majority of the directors in our survey (59%) indicated that it can be very or extremely difficult to exit a director from a board without formal age or term limits. The difficulty frequently lies in the challenge of having the tough conversations with directors who have loyally served on the board for many years.

According to <a href="https://www.equilar.com/blogs/258-age-and-tenure-large-cap-vs-small-cap-board.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data gathered by Equilar</a> and reported by the Society for Corporate Governance in 2017, the average tenure of directors in both large-cap and small-cap companies is more than nine years. Furthermore, for those boards that do have tenure limits, they range from nine to 20 years. With those long average tenures, it is not surprising that some directors stay on boards past their prime-contribution years. So how can boards overcome the challenge of ensuring they are composed of directors with skillsets and capabilities that meet the needs of the organizations they are charged with governing?

The answers to this question lie in having processes to annually <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-assessment/">evaluate the skills matrix</a> and how each director maps against those needs, as well as in courageous board leaders willing to have difficult conversations. Here are some steps boards can take:
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1">Nominating and governance committees should annually update the skills matrix and the fit of current directors against the matrix.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Board bylaws and committee charters need to specify that every director’s contribution and fit with the board’s needs will be assessed each year.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">When a director joins a board, there should be a fulsome conversation led by the board chair or lead director about what contribution that director needs to make.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Re-nomination and re-election should not be automatically assumed but rather determined each year.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Boards should also have rigorous continuing-education requirements and expectations for directors that they will stay current on the range of issues relevant to the business of the organization and best-governance practices.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Each board member should receive annual feedback about how they are contributing and how they might contribute even more value in the future. Continuing-education actions can be outlined for each director at these feedback meetings.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Succession planning for board- and committee-leadership roles should be an annual process, with exit timetables outlined in the skills matrix for directors who no longer fit board needs or whose tenure approaches the specified term limit.</li>
</ol>
Meeting the challenge of <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-founder/">retiring directors from boards</a> is best accomplished when an ethos is established whereby it is understood that as the business landscape changes, the experiences, expertise and value proposition for board members need to keep pace with what the organization needs from its board. This process is not just about retiring underperforming directors but also ensuring a continual refresh of the board’s capability to contribute value. Conscientious executives who decide to join a board want to add value and make a positive difference. Rather than rely on general assumptions about how to do that, new directors should be engaged in discussions about how the board is expected to add value and the role they need to play to contribute to that value. Taking these steps will ensure that boards are composed of directors who are fully engaged and maximizing the contribution they make to the success of the enterprise.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b><i>A leader’s evolving self-concept</i></b>

We all have a self-concept; the term refers to who we understand ourselves to be. It encompasses the attributes that we consider stable (“No matter what situation I’m in, I’m always detail-oriented”) and the roles that we play relative to the others in our life (“I’m more patient as a board member than I am as a CEO”). A healthy and accurate self-concept enables us to derive purpose, value, and meaning from our work: the fruits of our labor provide evidence that we have lived up to our personal remit. In-depth knowledge of one’s own self-concept is especially relevant for executives who must be effective across many settings. In any week, the typical RHR client engages with direct reports, authority figures, peers, customers, shareholders, business partners, and others in the value chain or competitive landscape. The array of roles and relationships can be dizzying, and an effective self-concept is one that enables fluidity across these shifting systems.

Today’s executives must be fast learners and decisive movers. They adapt on the fly, picking up new information, and charting a course amidst complexity and ambiguity. Rarely do they have time to pause and consciously adjust their self-concept so that it accurately reflects the additional knowledge, responsibilities, and positional power that they acquire as their careers progress. We often see clients getting “stuck” in prior self-concepts without realizing it: they stay involved in details or activities that are too low-level rather than stepping up to own the roles and attributes that are most valuable in the present moment. We propose that leaders benefit when they pause to ensure, with intentionality, that they have kept their self-concept up to date. Showing up with a self-concept that is more suited to your prior role(s) is far more career and performance-limiting than wearing last season’s fashions.

To maintain a current self-concept, leaders need to frame their evolution across three sets of trade-offs. Each requires intentionality: as leaders’ careers and remits grow, their investments of time and energy must evolve. These three trade-offs encompass: what leaders should <b><i>know</i></b>, what they should <b><i>do</i></b>, and how they should <b><i>add value</i></b>.
<ol>
 	<li>As <b>Knowers</b>, we all ground our careers in the fundamentals of our work. Hard-earned knowledge of the business enables an increase in the scope and scale of our accountabilities. As we step up, we are limited by finite human bandwidth and capacity, and we must redirect our awareness and focus to new challenges. Accordingly, we delegate the more granular details to those on our team. In parallel, our self-concept must evolve. Where we previously derived purpose and pride from our in-depth knowledge of the business, we must now gain those good feelings from our knowledge of the people on our teams, and our understanding of their capacity and potential. As <b>Knowers</b>, we transition our expertise to knowing whom to trust with the details and—through self-awareness—knowing what we require from team members who seek to earn our trust.</li>
 	<li>As <b>Doers</b>, our initial roles are ones in which the output of our work is concrete—a model, a design, a narrative—and it clearly advances the team’s progress toward a tangible business goal. Over time, expertise in task performance enables us to manage and mentor others who do similar work, and we advance to roles where we define and oversee the work of many. Steady promotions to the point where we are several layers removed from deliverable creation can be disorienting to those who happily identified as top performers or doers. However, to add the value that the organization needs, we must adjust our self-concept to reflect the breadth of our oversight and influence. Our deliverable now is an intangible: we clear the path for those who are creating concrete output. We focus our attention on the stakeholders for whom our team’s deliverables are critical inputs, and we spend our time understanding their needs and adjusting their expectations. To be effective at this work, our self-concept as <b>Doers</b> must reflect the crucial impact of anticipating and removing obstacles and driving broad acceptance of new ideas or methods.</li>
 	<li>As <b>Value Adders</b>, early career contributions are grounded in facts and analyses. We feel good when we have illuminated an issue, enhanced others’ understandings, or informed a key decision. As the breadth and depth of our knowledge increases, <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">we grow as mentors and coaches</a>. In lieu of finding the best answer ourselves, it becomes more valuable for us to teach others how to find the answer. Eventually, we transcend the realm of “right answer”: roles at the top traffic in ambiguity, trade-offs, and shifting circumstances. At this point, our self-concept must empower a different <b>Value Add</b>: the most important contribution we can make is to augment others’ confidence rather than their knowledge base. We do this by showing up in ways that integrate inspiration with intellectual humility, coming across as connected and caring even at a distance, and galvanizing performance with a compelling message and presence.</li>
</ol>
If the concepts described here resonate with you, we encourage you to look at the career trajectory in this visual.

Each of these three trade-offs is represented across a career timeline. Consider each one, and ask yourself, “Where am I currently showing up as a Knower? A Doer? A Value Adder?” If you’ve printed this out, make a mark on each of the three trade-off timelines. Then ask yourself where you need to be in order to be as effective as possible in your current role. If there is a gap to close between those two marks, doing so represents the work of updating your self-concept. We wish you energy and intentionality as you undertake it.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted lives throughout the world. The social distancing we have reluctantly adopted to protect ourselves from the threat of contamination has reduced or eliminated our in-person interactions with the people who have been a part of our social experience. We are now hunkered down with only a few others and <i>with ourselves</i>. Both the occupation of our time and attention at work as well as outlets for our entertainment and diversion have been greatly reduced or removed altogether. We have been challenged to develop new ways to spend our waking hours.

These changes in lifestyle combined with the existential threat that the pandemic presents certainly give us the opportunity to benefit from the gift of reflection. In the course of our normal lives, we are mostly occupied with the execution of our daily tasks of work, family responsibilities, social activities, hobbies, and recreation. Now with much of those activities interrupted or postponed, we have more time to reflect on how precious and precarious our lives are and to ask ourselves some important questions:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">What is my life’s purpose?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What am I learning about myself and about what is most important to me during this time?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Who are the people I care about most, and how do I demonstrate that to them?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">When this current threat and disruption of my life has passed, what lessons can I take from the experience once I restart?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">How will I act differently going forward to honor my values and core purpose?</li>
</ul>
We are all in positions to influence and lead others. Whether as a manager or co-worker, as a parent or sibling, as a neighbor or member of a community organization, how we present ourselves in our words and actions reflects our values and impacts the other people we interact with. During this time, we might ask ourselves:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">What do I stand for?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What insights and core values do I want to impart to those whom I have the opportunity to influence?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">When life without restrictions restarts again, what do I want my new normal to be?</li>
</ul>
It’s been said that we should “never let a good crisis go to waste.” Let’s not waste the time for reflection presented to us by this crisis.]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Covid-19 is dramatically revealing that we are a globally connected world. While ramifications of the spread of a virus are felt globally, the solutions will need to be targeted and enacted at the local level. Placing the entire world under quarantine is a good crisis response, but it is not a solution.

Currently, local governments are defaulting to the lowest common denominator. With no overarching plan, they are using one solution for all populations (e.g., keep everyone home or pay everyone in the U.S. $1,000 to help with bills). Although that might be the right initial reaction, ideally the next round of problem-solving will bring more targeted solutions. In crisis scenarios, the best leaders know how to shift resources quickly to the right places. They do not equally resource all parts of their business or organization. Rather, they quickly analyze the problem and focus time, attention, and money toward the core of the issue. If you apply that thinking to public health, a targeted solution could be to provide extra resources to healthcare providers and community leaders for rapid testing, rapid isolation, and care for those infected with Covid-19 while ensuring extra caution with the most vulnerable populations.

For business <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-founder/">leaders</a>, it is worth asking what targeted measures they can take to provide financial stability and liquidity to last through the crisis. Namely, can you retain parts of the business and keep everyone healthy without shutting everything down? For example, imagine you are a CEO of a retail organization with stores and distribution across the globe. You closed your stores and your offices and now are faced with closing distribution centers. Once you close distribution, you hemorrhage even more cash and will be faced with an inability to keep people on payroll. Are there ways to safely keep distribution centers open so you can keep people employed? What can we learn from industry sectors like food and grocery that are already tackling this problem? There have to be solutions that can protect both the physical health of employees while maintaining business continuity. But it won’t be the same one for every company nor every part of the country. Work with your teams and find ways to think outside the box.
<ul>
 	<li><span>What do you have control of?</span></li>
 	<li><span>What assumptions are you making?</span></li>
 	<li><span>What would you do if you gave yourself permission not to run your business the way you always run it?</span></li>
 	<li><span>What parts of your business can be done remotely?</span></li>
 	<li><span>What environments can be isolated so that healthy people can be safely brought together?</span></li>
 	<li>What personal sacrifices can we make for the good of the whole?</li>
</ul>
Think targeted. Think local. Take care of those around you, and we can slowly lift out of this crisis.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Anyone in a leadership position at this point in time is likely feeling a great deal of pressure and personal responsibility to do the right thing without the advantage of a clear and dependable playbook. With these unprecedented and uncertain times, we can utilize wisdom from the past to <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-founder/">help leaders be a stabilizing force</a> as we try to make sense of our present environment and prepare for what lies ahead. Demonstrating resilience in these turbulent times is critical to weathering adversity. Here are some quick reminders that can help leaders stay strong and be present for their people as the sands around them shift.
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>It is okay to be vulnerable:</strong> Leaders are not infallible, but in times of intense crisis and panic, many feel the need to be. It’s acceptable not to have all the answers and be imperfect. Be authentic and true to yourself. Be real and human. Be honest with yourself and those around you.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Re-evaluate your short- and long-term focus:</strong> Leaders are often tasked with thinking broadly to create long-range strategic plans for the future. However, our current situation requires leaders to ensure the safety and security of their employees in the short term. Given the level of uncertainty and pressure on contingency planning for the business, it’s okay to default to shorter timelines. <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">Develop a daily sense of purpose</a>—where can I add impact and value today? What do my people need from me now? When things feel beyond our control, it is important to break down complexity so that we can focus on immediate priorities and things that are within our control.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Be clear and thoughtful about what type of leadership people need:</strong> We all have our own perspective on what a great leader looks like. A more useful heuristic at the moment is to ask, “what leadership do people need from me at the present time?” For example, people who have challenges or difficulties are not always asking for their problems to be solved. Currently, <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-teams/">your team is likely to need more reassurance</a>, empathy, a listening ear, or to feel understood. On other occasions, people may require stronger direction to regain a sense of control and focus. Listen for signs that you need to step forward and grab the wheel versus listening and guiding.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Pay insights forward: </strong>We’re currently inundated with advice and guidance. Some of it is truly useful. As a leader you can help distill the most important messages and create clarity for others. More importantly, information that is based on shared human experience can be extra powerful. Stories help create intimacy, which is something that many of us are currently lacking. Share information that helps people feel grounded and connected. Communicating a collective message—“at times like this, we all…”—can help normalize feelings and experiences that many often feel alone with.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Remember to recharge: </strong>Leaders need time to recharge and regroup just like anyone else. Working from home consistently is new for many people and finding the sense of balance we had previously can be difficult. It is okay to retreat, but don’t disappear. Take the time you need to get your head straight so you can be present and engaged with others. Know your limits and take care of the basics (nutrition, sleep, exercise) so you can bring your best self to the table. And of course, get the emotional support you need...you are just human after all!</li>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Chief executive officers and companies are navigating tremendously difficult decisions in response to COVID-19 with regard to how to keep employees and customers safe while remaining financially solvent. Yet other big decisions loom on the horizon. Namely, what are the unintended consequences of slamming the economy to a halt and asking healthy people to remain home? And how long can we do it? Inarguably, the rapid response of business and local government to shut down and help flatten the curve is the right thing to do, yet another set of hard questions and trade-offs lie in wait.

Warren Buffet has a saying, “When the tide goes out, you find out who has been swimming naked.” With exceptions of places like Singapore, which has kept spread low, COVID-19 is quickly illuminating our “naked” vulnerability and lack of global preparedness for a pandemic health crisis. With no readiness precautions, the U.S. and local communities are doing what most groups of people do when an existential threat emerges, which is get to safety, hunker down, focus on critical needs, gather experts, protect those close to you, and wait to understand options.

What emerges after an immediate threat subsides is you start to lift your head up, look around, and weigh your options. In this instance, some people will look up and start to question the collateral damage of shutting the economy down. Although we are protecting public health, we are creating a different type of crisis where vulnerable wage workers and small businesses won’t survive. In attending to a legitimate fear and concern for personal health, we are creating another set of issues by increasing the financial threat to the economically vulnerable. This scenario raises important questions that the government and <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-founder/">business leaders</a> will need to face in coming weeks. Very hard questions will emerge—with no good trade-offs—but they are worth pondering. Namely:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">At what point can you/we no longer justify keeping healthy people away from their economic livelihoods?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">When is the rate of new infections low enough to send people back to work? What other decision criteria ought we be considering?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What are the emotional, mental, and social costs of creating financial vulnerability combined with social isolation? How long can your family, workforce, and others tolerate that decision?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Are there ways we can redeploy our workforce to expedite our way out of this crisis?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What have we learned so that we do not get ourselves in this position again?</li>
</ul>
As with most difficult questions, there are key trade-offs, and the sooner leaders can clarify their own points of view, the better prepared we will all be. The human soul is restless, and in the weeks that come, leaders will be faced with pressure to lift bans and restore order. Without clear guidance, it is not difficult to imagine people taking it into their own hands to stimulate an underground economy like they did under Prohibition. Leaders will want to think ahead and understand decision criteria now. What information and personal values will guide you? Who are the experts we can trust to help guide us? Big decisions are looming.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“The quality of strength lined with tenderness is an unbeatable combination.”

This quote from Maya Angelou elegantly expresses what is needed from leaders now. We’ve never been here before—as people and as organizations. In this scary and uncertain place, <i>strong </i><i>and</i> <i>empathetic leadership</i> is called for. This means that a leader must continue showing the way, changing that way if necessary, and focusing or refocusing the team in the proper direction. Such strength, in a context of personal and group attunement, bonds people together like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zot0kIq5aKM">quarantined Italians</a> singing from their balconies.

To an unprecedented degree, leaders are trying to create that sense of direction and support over video and phone conferences. Thus, in a time of social distancing and virtual working, leaders must answer: how do I maintain a collectivist, focused culture in the teams I lead?

Four team dimensions—what, how, who, and why—are useful for addressing this question.

<b>What</b>: In terms of the team’s goals and shared agenda, the most basic and foundational thing a leader can do is acknowledge that we are in uncharted territory that requires a new normal. Pretending that we can keep operating in the same way, except virtually, will be counterproductive. What should leaders do?
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Distinguish between “controllables” and “uncontrollables" and focus on the former. The speed and uncertainty of current events can lead to learned helplessness, where people feel they have no power to influence events. Counter this by encouraging the team to focus on what they <i>can</i> influence, no matter how small. This will give team members a focus and will stimulate empowerment.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Conduct scenario planning. In times of uncertainty like these, leaders can help teams distinguish between what is possible (worse-case scenario) and what is probable (a more likely result). Collectively planning for different future scenarios can give the team a sense of certainty and preparedness.</li>
</ul>
<b>How:</b> This dimension relates to the processes that the team can leverage to stay connected and get work done. Technology is the most obvious and fundamental shift with regard to team working. Once you have figured out how Zoom/Google Hangouts/Skype works, what’s next? Focus on creating virtual intimacy and empathy. The importance of this cannot be underestimated. How should leaders accomplish this?
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">We know from research that teams tend to get to tasks quicker when meeting virtually than in person. This can leach strength from the shared relationship among members. Counter this by building time at the start and the end of the meeting to foster virtual closeness. Check in with each other at the start of the meeting; ask where are people at, how are they feeling? End the meeting by checking in again—where did we get, and how are people feeling?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Make time for each other. Avoid overfilling the meeting agenda or trying to rush a list of items in a short space of time. This can create a mechanical or transactional feel for team members and reduce engagement and alignment.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Create inclusive rituals. Virtual meetings can encourage passivity and one-way communication. Mute yourself to allow other team members to talk and resist jumping into long silences that may occur as people decide whether to speak. Ensure everyone is involved by setting up some simple ground rules or virtual etiquette. Use interactive features such as polling, if available, to encourage participation.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Create engaging ways for team members to connect outside of scheduled meetings. Our own team has just set up a WhatsApp group to stay connected and check in with each other using short messages, emojis, clips—very little business or work-related stuff. Slack offers a similar environment while Basecamp is a more project-focused platform that includes the kind of social interactivity that is important in these times.</li>
</ul>
<b>Who:</b> This relates to the personalities and relationships of the individuals on the team. Creating a supportive team environment, whether virtual or in person, includes sharing personal stories and being open about emotions. This helps create an environment of psychological safety where trust is built and bonds are formed. As a leader in today’s virtual working environment, you can:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Share your own story, the highs and lows you are experiencing as a result of the crisis, and strategies you have found helpful to maintain perspective.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Encourage others to discuss what their stress response is, how it plays out, and what they need from the team to feel grounded. Talking about this can also help people separate truth from “mind fiction,” the type of thinking that can add stress from worrying about things that aren’t actually happening.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Empathize with colleagues, their families, and their home situations. The ability to see things from other perspectives and walk in their shoes is important. Tough decisions need to be made both now and in the coming months, and your empathy can be invaluable.</li>
</ul>
<b>Why:</b> This final dimension relates to the fundamental purpose of the team. The role they play as a group—in society, with customers, with those deeper in the organization—will typically provide anchorage and be the glue that sticks the team together when everything else feels unstable. Now more than ever, leaders need to step in and lead with purpose. What can they do?
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Listen to your teams. At this time, when the fulfilment of basic needs is shaky and when colleagues may be laid off, tune in to the temperature of the team.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Be purpose driven in your leadership. Clearly articulate the <i>why</i> to your teams. Let your values shine through and lead the way. Be honest about communicating the ways in which events are shaping you as a leader and where you need their help.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Encourage the connection between what the team is facing and the broader ecosystem. What can the team do to connect with the wider community? How can we leverage what we are good at to help those who are suffering and more vulnerable?</li>
</ul>
As unprecedented events in the world trigger both the worst and the best of human behavior, it is good to keep returning to the question we began with: How do leaders maintain a collectivist, focused culture in the teams they lead? Leadership that expresses “strength lined with tenderness” will motivate and focus teams during these and other turbulent times. Some teams will emerge far stronger from this “in vivo” experiment in team development. They will have demonstrated support and focus, increased candor, speed, and a spirit of community.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the first two parts of this series about how leaders can improve their ability to cope with and bounce back from negative or stressful situations, we offered five of the seven tips below to consider putting into practice:
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1">Be attached, but not too attached.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Keep learning.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Accept help when it's needed.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Stay in the moment.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Develop both mind and body.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Maintain an attitude of gratitude.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Follow a routine to close each day.</li>
</ol>
In this last part of the series, our consultants discuss the final two tips, including practical ways to incorporate them into daily activity.
<h2><b>Maintain an attitude of gratitude.</b></h2>
<i>Get in the habit of taking stock of what’s good.</i>

The good news about resilience is that, like emotional intelligence, it’s a capability that we can strengthen. One proactive strategy I recommend is cultivating a gratitude practice. Developing a habit of regularly and mindfully taking stock of what’s going well in your life and what you’re grateful for helps fortify your emotional shock absorbers so you can better respond to and learn from the setbacks and challenges you’ll inevitably encounter. A second strategy I try to follow when I’m in the midst of a difficult situation—especially when I have limited control over the outcome—is to shift my perspective. I imagine how I’ll feel about the current situation in a week, then a month, and finally a year. I invariably gain a better perspective and can deal more constructively and resiliently with today’s issue. I’m using this exercise right now as I sit in a hot airport in Havana, Cuba, with three hungry, bored kids awaiting a significantly delayed flight home that’ll likely derail our New Year’s Eve plans. Although I’m frustrated at the moment—and will probably still be a little disappointed next week about having missed a festive night out—I also know it’ll be a minor blip on my radar a month from now, and I’ll have a funny “lousy New Year’s Eve” story to tell in a year.

<i>Spread your good words.</i>

<a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/about-rhr/our-team/gene-morrissy">Gene Morrissy</a>

I am all about "two for ones" (aka twofers). When I see or experience someone doing something well, I like to tell them and their boss about it. We all get enough complaints as we go through life, so it's nice to hear something positive when it’s warranted. Happily, I never run out of subject matter. I have seen airline gate agents and flight attendants, restaurant servers, administrative assistants, and colleagues all do terrific things. Letting them and their bosses know is a positive charge for me. It fuels my resilience. Plus, the object of my good words also gets a shot of resilience out of it! A twofer, for sure. I have heard back with appreciation from chief executive officers, managers, and supervisors when I have shared a great story about one of their employees. I might add that it doesn't hurt to do it with members of your family!
<h2><b>Follow a routine to close each day.</b></h2>
<i>Consciously end the day and prepare for the next.</i>

Taking opportunities to step back from our busy lives helps cultivate resilience. Embedding a close-of-day routine is a golden version of this. Rest and recovery are critical to ensure we recharge fully so that we have the energy to consistently inject quality in everything we do. The purpose is to fully switch off and detach from work and other life pressures by consciously closing the day. Do this by first recognizing any achievements—noticing along the way the things for which you are grateful. Then, take time to plan for the next day. This will also help you step back from being drawn into just doing what’s in front of you and shift to making time to progress on key goals and key tasks that need completion in the near term. It’s best to do this as a sequence of planned time slots in your calendar instead of just a to-do list so that you can allocate realistic amounts of time to get through tasks. Once you’ve completed your close-of-day routine, turn off all laptops, iPads, and phones; stick them on their chargers somewhere out of sight; and leave them there until the next morning.

<i>Make the last thoughts of the day positive ones.</i>

<a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/about-rhr/our-team/grant-w-levitan">Grant Levitan</a>

A nice way to close out the day as your head hits the pillow is to reflect on three positive things that you accomplished over the course of the day. We often get caught up in reviewing or ruminating over things that didn't go well, which can lead to constructive changes but is seldom edifying or energizing. Identifying three things you feel good about accomplishing sends you to sleep in a good frame of mind for a night of rejuvenating, sound sleep and pleasant dreams.

Resilience is a very important part of every leader’s skillset. We invite you to consider the tips our consultants have offered in the context of your own life and hope that some, if not all, make a positive difference in your ability to cope with stress.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the second of a three-part series that spotlights our consultants’ observations about cultivating resilience. In <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/seven-tips-cultivating-resilience-part-one">part one</a>, their insights focused on the first three of these seven tips:
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1">Be attached, but not too attached.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Keep learning.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Accept help when it’s needed.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Stay in the moment.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Develop both mind and body.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Maintain an attitude of gratitude.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Follow a routine to close each day.</li>
</ol>
While there is a genetic component in the ability of a person to bounce back in healthy ways from negative situations and stressors, research is indicating that we can train our brains and bodies to improve resilience. The next two of our seven tips to help leaders cultivate resilience are recommended parts of that training.
<h3>Stay in the moment.</h3>
<i>Be here now.</i>

<a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/about-rhr/our-team/jeff-kirschner"><i>Jeff Kirschner</i></a>

One approach to cultivating resilience is to be fully present in daily activities. Too often leaders devote time to thinking and worrying about work when they are away from the office, or about home when they are at work. This can substantially add to stress. While you may need some practice, being fully present can help a person to maximize the opportunity in every moment and to have more impact on life.

<i>Set yourself up to stay in the moment.</i>

<a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/about-rhr/our-team/steven-gilbert"><i>Steven Gilbert</i></a>

It's so easy in this era of competing demands to be constantly thinking about the next thing versus really soaking in and engaging in the moment that we are in. It’s important to create “policies” for yourself to help achieve resilience by staying present. For example, when I spend time with my daughter, I put my phone aside completely and focus fully on her and what she needs. I find that by doing this I feel a deeper sense of connection and achievement. Without this everything can feel like a task rather than a moment to replenish and have a sense of impact.
<h3>Develop mind and body.</h3>
<i>Build and maintain physical resilience.</i>

<a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/about-rhr/our-team/david-astorino"><i>David Astorino</i></a>

Central to resilience is our ability to increase our capacity for stress and how quickly we can recover from it. On the physical side, getting enough sleep, eating mostly healthy foods, monitoring caffeine and alcohol consumption, and staying in motion throughout the day are all important. Also important is building physical resilience by increasing metabolic activity. Resistance training (e.g., weightlifting) and HIIT (high-intensity interval training) are two great ways to increase physical resilience. These types of workouts, when combined with adequate recovery, build our physical house so that we can be emotionally centered, mentally present, and acting in ways that align with our goals.

<i>Master managing your physiology and emotions</i>.

<a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/about-rhr/our-team/nick-twyman"><i>Nick Twyman</i></a>

Resilience is about being able to go harder, faster, longer and recover more quickly, and controlling your physiology to stay positively activated is important. With practice you can notice your emotional state and shift quickly to a more positive state. Using a technique to <i>take a perspective on your perspective</i> is key to shifting from reacting to mindfully responding. The first step is to focus on your breathing. Rhythmic and even, diaphragmatic breathing is a great way to reset your physiology to a neutral or positive state. The second step is to observe yourself; completing the phrase “Look at me ____” can help you shift your perceptual position. For example, “Look at me getting upset/frustrated/anxious/excited.” Once we are observing the state, we are better placed to stop and shift to a more useful state.

<i>In the </i><a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/seven-tips-cultivating-resilience-part-three"><i>third and final installment</i></a><i> of “Seven Tips for Cultivating Resilience,” we will consider gratitude and a key routine as tools for staying centered and able to bounce back.</i>]]></content:encoded>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was at a dinner party the other evening. Two of the guests were CEOs of very well-known and highly regarded organizations who have served on multiple boards. At one point, the conversation of the evening turned to the topic of corporate governance, and one of the CEOs posed the question, “can a board actually deliver value?” The question was based on the assumption that the business of most large, global companies is extremely complex and difficult for a part-time board member to understand in sufficient enough depth to provide useful guidance and counsel.

As I pondered this question and reflected on the boards I have worked with on conducting annual evaluations and advising, I was reminded of a director I met at a board conference about 10 years ago. This director shared a compelling story that has stayed with me these many years. A few years earlier, in 2006, he had joined the board of a regional financial institution that had significant investments in mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps. At his first board meeting, the CFO of the organization was making a presentation to the directors on the performance of the portfolio of invested assets. This director recounted how he asked questions to better understand what risk exposure to the enterprise these investments presented, being unfamiliar with these vehicles. It turns out, several other board members were also unfamiliar with these vehicles and also expressed the desire to better understand these investments. The CFO was tasked with coming back to the board in the following board meeting to more thoroughly describe how these investment vehicles worked. In response to the following discussion and this director’s persistent inquiry, the board decided to exit all of their positions in mortgage-backed securities due to their discomfort with the risk exposure. In 2007 and 2008, when the financial crisis hit and many of this institution’s competitors were decimated, the organization that this director served was spared and managed through the crisis intact.

This story underscores the value a board—even a single director—can provide by asking difficult questions and challenging management to really dive into opportunities and threats. It also underscores the importance of courage in the boardroom, as it would have been easier and safer for this new director to have stayed silent and not revealed his own ignorance (which apparently his fellow directors had done up to that point).

The question about the value of a board also reminded me of a series of questions that my firm asked directors and senior executives in 67 client companies about what an organization needs its board to contribute. Seeking to tap the insights of these leaders who served organizations from a cross-section of industries in companies ranging from Fortune 100 global companies to start-ups, one question we asked was, “what are the most important things a board needs to pay attention to in order to contribute value to the organization it governs?” The most common responses were, in order: 1. digging into the performance of the company to understand value creation and value-protection opportunities, 2. succession planning for mission-critical roles and the development of talent, and 3. organizational climate/culture. Having a board paying attention to these things and ensuring that top management is paying attention to these things was viewed as the greatest contribution that a board can make.

So as you think about the boards you serve on and work with, think about how the board is digging into these three areas: the levers that are driving performance, mission-critical talent development and succession, and organizational culture. If these three things are getting the proper attention from a board, and as a result, from senior management—with the courage of board members to ask provocative questions—a company’s prospects can be significantly enhanced, and the board is doing its job in delivering value.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The world moves fast, and daily demands on attention and energy can create stress in our personal and professional lives. Over time, stress can contribute to mental and physical health issues, some of them quite serious. While it would be great if we could come up with ways to eliminate stressors, we often can’t sufficiently control our environment to pull this off. So how can we counter the effects of stress? By cultivating resilience.

<i>Resilience is the ability to recover from stress and other negative challenges and to flourish in spite of them.</i>

It is an important part of successful leadership, and while there is a genetic component to a person’s resilience, that is only part of the equation. Research has found that anyone can train themselves to be more resilient.

We asked our consultants for their recommendations on how leaders can cultivate resilience. Their observations distill down to seven key tips:
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1">Be attached, but not too attached.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Keep learning.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Accept help when it’s needed.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Stay in the moment.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Develop both mind and body.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Maintain an attitude of gratitude.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Follow a routine to close each day.</li>
</ol>
Specific insights are offered here and in subsequent articles.
<h2><b>Be Attached, but Not Too Attached.</b></h2>
<a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/about-rhr/our-team/nick-twyman">Nick Twyman</a>

Maintain the right level of attachment. Being driven and focused with clear stretch goals is a quality much admired in leaders. However, becoming too attached to outcomes can lead to too much personal association with the results. When results are at risk, we tend to focus on the negative and lose perspective and objectivity. This can have a physiological effect that has a strong adverse effect on clear thinking, logic, and decision-making—the resources a leader needs to perform optimally.
<h2><b>Keep Learning.</b></h2>
<i>Use setbacks to learn.</i>

<a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/about-rhr/our-team/jeff-kirschner">Jeff Kirschner</a>

What matters is not falling down but getting back up and moving forward. We all have negative experiences, but the important thing is to learn from them and use your experience to build knowledge. That knowledge will help you traverse the challenges in your future.

<i>Look back, forward, and somewhere new.</i>

<a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/whats-new/rhr-in-the-news/liza-jager-joins-rhr-international-chicago">Liza Jager</a>

During times of pressure or uncertainty, leaders can feel stuck. Looking back, forward, and somewhere new is an easy framework that can keep leaders moving ahead while also building resilience and cultivating new learnings. Here is how it works: First, look back and think of a time when you were able to move past a challenge or stressor, or accomplished something extraordinarily difficult. What kept you going? What made you resilient? And how can you apply this learning to the current situation? Connect that moment to a feeling or thought that you can keep in mind as a source of internal inspiration. Second, look forward by taking a long-view perspective, keeping desired end results in mind. This will help contextualize the current situation, reminding you that it is only a single step or moment among many on the path to achievement. Finally, look somewhere new to incorporate a new approach and get out of your comfort zone. Small additions, such as looking at the situation through someone else’s eyes or asking questions in new ways, can help you to gain new perspective and ensure continuous learning.
<h2><b>Accept Help When It’s Needed.</b></h2>
<i>Ask the right people for the right help and accept it when it is offered.</i>

<a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/about-rhr/our-team/maja-egnell">Maja Egnell</a>

Sometimes a leader operates under the assumption that responsibility for resolving challenges means taking on the tough stuff solo. They might see the act of asking for or accepting help as a weakness and, therefore, to be avoided. This can result in the opposite of resilience, creating unalleviated stress that has a negative impact on the ability to lead. A wise colleague recently told me that, “Challenge plus support equals resilience.” Accept the support that others are willing to give and proactively ask the right people for the right help. When people say, "Let me know what I can do to support you," respond by requesting very specific assistance. It could be picking their brains over a meal or asking them to roll up their sleeves and go tactical on necessary tasks. Asking for help can be a humbling experience, especially for those in leadership roles, but in reality, it creates closer and more enduring bonds with others. Accepting someone's help is a symbol of both vulnerability and strength and can be inspiring and motivational to those around you.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>This is the second part of a two-part series.</i>

Through our ongoing work with boards, we began to ask the question<i>: Are there specific aspects of a board chair role that, if demonstrated at a very high level, are most likely to make the difference between a good board and a great one? </i>

We found that the answer is yes, there are actually two. In the <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/becoming-great-board-chair">previous article in this series</a> we focused on the first aspect, the board chair’s ability to establish a very high and consistent level of trust with the other directors and the impact this has on specific areas of board functioning.

The second factor that significantly increases the likelihood of a high-functioning board is a chairperson who actively and routinely seeks and uses feedback about their effectiveness in the role. When we developed our Board Development Survey* and the Great Boards benchmark norm, we found that members who feel strongly that their chairperson seeks and utilizes feedback were significantly more likely to be serving on a highly effective board. This simple (but not necessarily easy) action on the part of the chair, when consistently demonstrated, becomes part of a virtuous cycle impacting multiple areas that enable the board to evolve. Board chairs who proactively model this behavior are substantially more likely to lead boards that excel at board renewal.

For example, when board chairs are actively seeking and using feedback about their leadership impact on the board, it is significantly more likely that each director is receiving annual performance feedback regarding how to maximize their contribution and that this feedback is specific, constructive, and actionable. The boards led by these chairs are also considerably more apt to have a systematic and efficient process for identifying additional skill sets needed on the board moving forward—and these boards are more likely to have highly effective processes for identifying, cultivating, and integrating new directors who can bring the necessary skill sets. [1]

While virtually all boards engage in an annual board evaluation process at this point, it is more likely that these evaluations are viewed as effective and identify real areas for improvement, versus a more rote, check-the-box approach. Fundamentally, board chairs who model obtaining and using feedback as a vital part of maximizing their ongoing performance in their role tend to set the stage (and expectation) for those around them to do the same. It is intriguing to note that in such cases this focus on evolution and renewal does not stop with the board itself. These individuals are also significantly more likely to lead boards that are regularly engaged in succession planning for the CEO and other mission-critical roles, ensuring that the organization is well prepared for future leadership transitions. [2]

Boards continue to face an increasingly complex and rapidly changing landscape of risks and opportunities, placing greater demands on directors and the board as a whole. However, through simple and consistent actions, the board chair can help maximize the odds that the board is continuing to evolve to bring its best to the company and its stakeholders.

*RHR’s Board Development Survey, designed to assist boards in identifying opportunities to improve their effectiveness, consists of 55 items across <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/evaluating-your-board-seven-areas-assess"><b>seven dimensions of governance</b></a><b>. </b>The original database was compiled from the responses of directors who collectively serve on 120 boards of mid-cap and large-cap companies. Our research shows that the strongest boards have strong chair leadership, healthy board dynamics characterized by candid debate, and a shared understanding of the organization’s financial, regulatory, and operational risk-tolerance levels.

For the full survey results, please contact kgilson@rhrinternational.com.

<b>[1]</b> The correlations between the behaviors in this section and the board chair seeking and utilizing feedback were all positive and significant, ranging from <i>r</i> =.46 to <i>r</i> = .50

<b>[2]</b> The correlations between the behaviors in this section and the board chair seeking and utilizing feedback were all positive and significant, ranging from <i>r</i> =.38 to <i>r</i> = .50

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is nearly impossible to escape from the unending stream of global unrest, and yet, in extraordinary times people turn to their leaders for guidance and reassurance more than ever before. The Edelman’s Trust Barometer of 2019 shows a global population increasingly pessimistic about the future, and with eroding trust in the institutions that govern the world we live in. Yet, of society’s core institutions (My employer, NGOs, Business, Government, Media), trust in one’s employer remains the most robust. Furthermore, more people than ever (76%) say that CEOs should take the lead on change rather than waiting for the government to impose it and 71% of employees agree that it’s critically important for their CEO to respond to challenging times.

Not all CEOs and leaders however have been prepared to meet this new set of expectations. Based on RHR’s years of experience in leading change and what we know about the behaviors of those facing times of uncertainty, we have put together our insights regarding the specific challenges you may be currently facing as a leader. We offer these four key concepts to help you think of your role in leading people during times of uncertainty: Inform, Connect, Guide, and Unite.
<h3>Inform</h3>
As people struggle to make sense of the evolving uncertainty around them and what it means for them and their employer, they are particularly hungry for information and analysis. For this reason, you may find that they are most open to frequent and ongoing communication efforts. Authenticity is of primary importance here. Leaders must candidly acknowledge the downsides and the unknowns the company is facing. This will create credibility when painting a picture of their organization’s strengths and encouraging people to focus on the solid fundamentals. Most importantly, it is the leader’s job to help people make sense of the changing conditions, anticipate the likely scenarios ahead, and give them the tools to help them make up their own minds about how to best deal with these situations.

TIP: Communicate early and frequently. The risk of overcommunicating is far less important than risking appearing out of touch with the current reality. Embrace humility. Tell the truth; overpromising is only likely to backfire.
<h3>Connect</h3>
As evidenced by Edelman’s research, it is important to generate a feeling of trust with your employees. This will not happen if your communications appear remote or artificial. People need to feel a personal presence and connection. Senior executives who reach out to their employees and foster warmth and support will be seen as a credible source of reassurance and information.

One way to do so is for leaders to acknowledge that they, too, are affected by the uncertainty in the world around them. Admitting it is not a sign of weakness. On the contrary, it signals that they are in touch with their own feelings and with others as fellow human beings.

TIP: In times of change and uncertainty, give people opportunities to safely express their emotions. Reach out to employees on a personal basis. Get out of your office and into the hallway. Be there for them. Encourage everyone to do the same. News of this will spread and positively affect the overall culture.
<h3>Guide</h3>
More than at any other time, during periods of uncertainty people want leaders who are comfortable giving direction on what to do and what not to do. However, inconsiderate or premature calls to “Put this behind us” and “Get back to work” will be counterproductive. Talking about the long-term visions and strategies of the company will not be effective when people are bracing for further bad news, or emotionally recovering from previous disclosures.

You may find it beneficial to start with more basic elements. The first step is to provide clear guidance on business- critical priorities that everyone can rally around and contribute to. As those concerns are being addressed, invite people to think of the unique skills and qualities that have kept them in business with their internal or external customers. How can they leverage those and make a difference to others who are dealing with the same issues?

TIP: Give steady guidance. Focus on the concrete steps on which all employees can align. Empower them to be part of the solution within that framework. Patiently hammer your message—its stability may be as important as its content.
<h3>Unite</h3>
Turbulent times remind us of the importance of human community. People value it and increasingly see their place of employment as a valid arena to experience that connection. They need to rally behind those things that bind them together. Leaders can pull their employees closer to the company by reinforcing what makes them a unique group. Chief executives can help crystallize these feelings to energize a group toward joint action. You may find that actively dealing with adversity will actually enhance a sense of togetherness and resilience as a community. The leader who taps into aspects of who people are and how they function sends a strong message in times of uncertainty: “What we’re doing now validates what we’ve always done; we can adapt to change and still be true to who we are.”

TIP: Celebrate who you are as a business community. Emphasize connectedness to your industry, your company, your customers, and one another.
<h3>The Importance of Leadership</h3>
The combination of uncertain times and the trust that people place in their employer presents a unique opportunity to reimagine your potential for influence to include not only the purely transactional role of management, but also the more personally engaged role of leadership. Those who do so will reap the rewards of a loyal group of people committed to the success of their company and connected to the world around them.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Like so many of my friends, family, and colleagues, I have spent these past few months thinking deeply about racism in our society, wondering how it got to be as systemically entrenched as it is and wracking my brain trying to figure out how we effect meaningful change.

In the immediate wake of George Floyd’s murder, I found myself drawn to different websites of organizations asking for donations to fight racism and better the lives of those who have been marginalized. It was easy for me to click the “donate” button, and I did so readily. I signed petitions, I forwarded them to friends and family, and I shook my head in disgust at what was happening in our society. And all of it left me feeling flat. It occurred to me that I was responding in a very privileged way. I was sitting in the safety of my own home, clicking buttons on my computer, simply because I could. Don’t get me wrong—organizations fighting for equality need money and petitions need to be signed, and I will continue doing these things, but for me, it is not enough.

As I was wrestling with what I could actually do to move the needle, a colleague of mine told me, “Don’t look to your Black brothers and sisters to solve this; this is a White person problem to solve. You need your Black brothers and sisters to help inform you about the reality of their experience, but it is then incumbent on those in positions of power to take actions that result in change.” It was a profound statement.

Some of the people I love most in this world are Black, and I realized I’ve been living in blissful ignorance, assuming that loving people is enough to create equality. It is not! It struck me that leaders of organizations are uniquely positioned to effect change, both within their organizations and within their communities.

As an executive coach, it has often been my practice to meet my clients “where they are,” focusing on the things that are most urgent to them. Recently, however, I have shifted this perspective a bit, and have challenged my clients to consider how they can leverage their positions of power to create meaningful, systemic change. These conversations have felt risky and uncomfortable, and I’ve wondered aloud whether they are the right ones to be having. I’m not sure I know the answer to that question—it is an ongoing learning experience, but the prompt has led to some significant and meaningful discussions with my clients. It has become increasingly clear that there are some specific things leaders can do, in addition to promoting talent acquisition and development programs to attract, retain, and promote minorities.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">First, recognize if you are in a position of power, influence, and privilege. You carry a responsibility to use that position as not only a force for good, but to drive change—embrace this responsibility and be willing to own solutions within your sphere of influence.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Second, acknowledge that there is an extraordinary amount of learning that needs to take place—for you personally and for your organization—and that this can only happen when people can come together honestly and authentically, with the goal of trying to understand the experiences of others.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Third, be willing to be vulnerable and say, “I’m not sure what the right answer is, but I’m committed to figuring it out.”</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Fourth, know that you will inevitably make mistakes. As hard as it may be, be willing to accept the feedback that is provided and commit to continued efforts to improve and learn.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Fifth, resist the urge to be silent. Even if born from fear of not knowing the “right thing to say,” your silence is complicity with maintaining the status quo and will not help to drive change.</li>
</ul>
On the surface, these may seem like obvious suggestions, but they can be surprisingly hard to enact both personally and professionally. Constructive conversations about inequality must be deeply grounded in trust, which is something that all leaders should be vigilant about building, now more than ever. Placing myself on this journey, I have learned a lot, know I need to learn more, and pledge to continue pushing myself and those I work with to take the actions that will allow me to meet this challenge. It is the only way forward if we want to create real change in companies and in our society.

Real change won't happen overnight, but we can all start to take small steps toward making a difference in our companies and society overall. Collective action can create systemic change.
<h3><strong>Appendix</strong></h3>
Over the past several weeks, these are some of the things I have done to try to be a force of good and create change:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">I have challenged my clients directly when I’ve heard biased statements or uninformed viewpoints. Where possible, I have offered perspectives, but I’ve also been an advocate for them looking at the various situations from the perspectives of people of color and trying to understand why they might see it differently from the White majority perspective.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">I have encouraged clients to speak up, even if they don’t know what to say or don’t have an answer. (I have suggested that just acknowledging that they don’t know what to say might be a good start.) It promotes transparency, builds trusts, and creates an environment for dialogue.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">I have asked my Black friends about their experiences with law enforcement. In one conversation, I asked, “Has there ever been a time when you have seen a police officer, say at a Fourth of July parade, where you have taken comfort in the idea that law enforcement was present?” The response I got was a quick, “No. Never have, never will.”</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">I have talked openly and honestly to my 16-year-old daughter about her responsibility to use her privilege to make the world a more equitable place, and I have listened to her when she told me to watch “13th” on Netflix.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">I have challenged my 75-year-old mother to consider that different dialects are not indicative of one’s intellect, but rather, are simply that—they are dialects that carry their own rules and cultural significance and should be respected, not judged.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We know by this blog’s title and what is going on in the world that you might be questioning this entire post and idea. But work with us for a few minutes. Prior to the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, which have sparked a response previously unseen regarding the issue of racism in America, we were dealing with a crippling pandemic. Most of us have been home for more than 15 weeks (and counting). Many of us have added new skills and roles like teacher, IT professional, tutor, daytime dog walker, and more. We have also gained respect for other professions that we took for granted pre-COVID. We have seen companies go completely remote and even make the decision to maintain that status through the end of 2020 and beyond.

With this new way of working from home, we are experiencing one another in different ways and are having greater access to people’s private lives. Given what we are collectively experiencing across the globe, there is greater opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of one another, to engage with our colleagues on another level, and, for leaders, to foster a <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">greater culture of diversity, inclusion, and belonging</a> within and across our organizations.

And now, as cities start to open up (and some needing to shut back down), we are faced with what the working world will look like as this continues to evolve. There is a very real possibility that people will continue to work from home even if a vaccine is found. Here are a few ideas and suggestions that individuals as well as company leadership should consider as we continue to work virtually, both in the short term as well as for those who will do so indefinitely:
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Connect with your colleagues in a new way.</b> With Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and every other online function, there is a chance to learn more about your colleagues on a personal level. Use the extra time when meetings end or during the occasional virtual happy hour to connect and check on your colleagues. You’ve <i>finally </i>got that invite over to their homes—we are not only seeing kitchens, offices, basements, and living rooms, but we are also learning about coworkers’ family dynamics via photobombs from their kids and pets, as well as gaining insights into how they work and optimize productivity. You may find other commonalities like favorite shows, movies, books, guilty pleasures, or hobbies that you would have never known otherwise. Be curious, share experiences, and engage broadly and inclusively. Embrace the chance to get to really know them.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Companies that will remain remote partially or completely can now attract and recruit a whole new population of diverse talent.</b> We have been a society where many believed that your physical presence in the office was required to ensure that work was getting done. We saw companies build vast campuses and implement all types of amenities to keep people on the premises and engaged. However, the pandemic has proven that countless jobs can be done productively from home. As a result, many companies will seek to reduce their physical imprint on cities across the country. Consequently, with many jobs moving to working from home, the ability to recruit diverse individuals increases as factors like location of the job become less salient. We know that many diverse individuals have other variables that are factored into their career choices and the companies they choose for employment. Some are parents, are taking care of parents, already have an established community, or simply do not want to work in cities that may not be as diverse as their current location. With a remote working option, many will be open to a wider choice of companies. Also, companies that may have struggled to recruit minority talent can now offer remote roles to take advantage of that broader base of talent while increasing their overall diversity makeup—it’s a win-win for everyone.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Leaders can be more proactive than ever before in creating space for debate and innovation.</b> Through the use of technology, leaders can now be more inclusive by bringing a greater number of team members together from near and far and inviting them into the conversation to ensure their voices and diverse perspectives are heard. Leaders should ensure that meetings and other interactions encourage this, as it is not only the right the thing to do, but it is also good organizational practice and has become a leadership imperative. This will help produce better outcomes and have a real impact on employees feeling engaged and included.</li>
</ol>
Although there will continue to be challenges with many working virtually, it is important to look at the bright spots and the many game-changing opportunities that have presented themselves that we must hold onto and leverage even further as we continue the reentry process back into our communities and workplaces over the coming weeks, months, and years ahead.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At the very end of May, I had the opportunity to engage with a group of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) leaders from across the country. This regular community call is a chance for them to stay in conversation on what is shifting and changing for their work given the pandemic. My role was a simple one; it was to share some of my observations as a leadership development and change management expert. It just so happened that this virtual meeting would occur the very day after the death of <a href="https://apnews.com/0eeb28e505231ce153c60559c921f5d3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">George Floyd</a> at the hands of a police officer. I entered a virtual space where the emotions were heavy with frustration and pain. Even then, I doubt anyone on that Zoom meeting could have predicted what would follow in the coming days and weeks.

The recent events including the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/26/us/central-park-video-dog-video-african-american-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Cooper</a> incident, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fired-atlanta-officer-garrett-rolfe-charged-rayshard-brooks-murder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deadly police brutality</a>, and protests have added another dimension to the role of DEI executives and leaders. Today the DEI leader is facing new priorities that require a greater depth of leadership.
<h2><strong>New Priorities</strong></h2>
As the United States continued to shelter in place during the months of March and April, inclusion issues and realities emerged and continue to do so with the reopening of the country.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Socioeconomic Diversity:</strong> Remote work and the closure of schools provided more transparency into the lives of employees. Companies assumed all of their employees had access to the same resources (e.g., high-speed internet, in-home childcare, adequate space) to work effectively from home, which was not true.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Mental Illness:</strong> The Kaiser Family Foundation <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> an increase in anxiety and depression across the United States as a result of COVID-19. Because of the psychological weight of this pandemic in addition to normal life challenges (e.g., death of a parent, moving, etc.), more people are accessing mental health support. A willingness to acknowledge mental illness as an aspect of one’s identity is on the rise.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Virtual Experience:</strong> Working and being productive in virtual work settings requires a new set of skills for all levels of employees. Because of differences in personality and communication style, resources are needed to help all of us adopt more inclusive behaviors during virtual working sessions and meetings.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Organic Culture Transformation: </strong>The culture of many organizations is shifting. Organizations will need to be intentional in crafting new norms as people return to the office or remain remote. Leaders will have to determine how to create a sense of belonging, inclusion, and safety in a new landscape.</li>
</ul>
These are just a few areas where DEI leaders were already recognizing the broadening of their scope.  Now add a national conversation about race equality that is blurring across corporate and personal life.
<h2><strong>A Need for Greater Depth</strong></h2>
As experts in <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-assessment/">leadership assessment</a> and <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">development</a>, RHR’s consultants have assessed thousands of leaders to determine their readiness to take on a larger, more complex role. Using our <a href="https://www.rhrinternationalconsultants.eu/sites/default/files/content/RFS%20Model.png">Readiness for Scale℠ model</a>, we assess leaders across a variety of positions, including DEI. It is with this lens that we are able to share some thoughts on the critical competencies that DEI leaders in large organizations will lean into as their role evolves in real time. The first of four posts, this post provides a high-level overview of the nine competencies we have identified as critical for leading in greater complexity. The subsequent posts will speak directly to what this looks like to DEI leaders.

Many DEI leaders were ready for this moment and saw it coming, but others are now quickly trying to resurrect their function after several weeks of winding down their programs. We hope this framework will help DEI leaders build a mental model to assess their strengths and gaps. This information might also serve as a guide for CEOs and CHROs who are on the search for their organization’s very first DEI leader.

Come back for the <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/the-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-leader-scaling-leadership-in-real-time-part-2/">next article</a>, which will discuss how DEI leaders will need to hold a “big picture” perspective, make critical decisions, and apply long-term thinking to their work. The focus will be on the competencies related to Leading Business.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>The times they are a changing?</strong></h2>
With the good news about the coronavirus vaccine, a note of optimism is being heard for the first time in months. It’s tempting to simply allow ourselves to believe that the panic is over and we can revert back to familiar ways of working like putting on an old favorite sweater. However, it’s clear that things are and will be different. The disruptive nature of the pandemic has challenged the normal “change leadership” that many have relied on in the past. Throughout the crisis, my colleagues have tapped into the deep well of RHR’s 75+ years of experience and have come up with a lot of great insight and advice about leadership through these uncertain times. This post offers a framework to help leaders focus on specific things that they can do to achieve their leadership ends in the challenging environment they currently face.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-1647 size-large" src="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/transition-model2-1024x521.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="326" />

First, let me share one of the main concepts that underpin the framework; the Bridges Model. It describes individual reactions to change and suggests that change can happen very quickly. However, it highlights that transition takes place much more slowly, and we might add, in some cases not at all. According to the Bridges Model, the process of transition is about moving from what is happening “now” that needs to change, through a “Neutral Zone” where new behaviors are learned and new processes are established, to a phase of “New Beginnings” - an energizing time of clarity on purpose, mission, and the role that everyone plays. Sounds nice, eh? Different organizations, different parts of the same organization, and different individuals will be at very different stages of this.

In times of crisis and disruption like we are going through now, leaders are challenged to cope with change and use its energy as the driving force to travel somewhere new. This framework helps leaders to do just that.
<h2><strong>Building the plane while flying it</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Dealing with now</strong></h3>
In times of crisis people look to their leaders for guidance and reassurance to deal with <i>now</i>. At RHR, we have carefully conceptualized four broad areas that enable leaders to best support and guide their teams during this time. Those are: Inform, Connect Guide and Unite.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Inform:</b> Communicate early and frequently to give clarity and manage expectations</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Connect:</b> Generate trust and give people the opportunity to express their feelings</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Guide:</b> Give direction and share concrete actions and steps</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Unite:</b> Focus on things that bind people and that demonstrate how and why we are all in this together</li>
</ul>
Part of the challenge for leaders stems from the question ‘how do I provide more reassurance than I, myself, may be feeling?’ and this highlights the often overlooked need for leaders to build their own resilience and look after their own wellbeing.  There is a very good reason why, in the event of an emergency on an aircraft, they tell you to put your own oxygen mask on first.
<h3><strong>Spotting the opportunities: “neutral zone”</strong></h3>
“Never let a crisis go to waste” is a well-known line that has fuzzy attribution. Whatever its origins, it is a call to find the opportunities that exist in conflicts and crisis. For example, the financial crisis in 2007/8 gave some businesses the opportunity to rethink the financial and contractual terms with suppliers that had long been in the area of “that’s just the way we do things.” This is the Neutral Zone - time to find new processes and behaviors as described in the Bridges Model.

For businesses emerging from the COVID-19 disruption, this is a clear opportunity to identify either the areas for change that have lacked the energy to push through, or the issues that have surfaced due to the current situation that lead to a rethink. Crisis tends to highlight where the weaknesses are, so it’s a good time to look at ways that processes can change.

For example, one client has spoken to me about the long resistance she had faced in her company to the idea of working from home. What a way to get proof of concept! Another example that is quite specific to the current situation may stem from the fact that people have been (or can be) given greater access to the “outside of work” aspects of colleagues’ lives (kids in the background, the books in the library, pictures on walls, the ways people dress outside of work, etc.). What opportunities does this give for developing insight and closeness in the team?
<h3><strong>What to do: “new beginnings”</strong></h3>
<a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">Leading through transition</a> to a new beginning can be usefully thought of as a process of encouraging new learning. To be holistic and practical, the goals of this learning can be loosely split into three areas: <i>knowing</i> (or head), <i>feeling</i>(heart), and <i>doing</i> (hands). As a leader, this helps to categorize not only what you might want to happen in these areas, but also to look at what <b><i>is</i></b> happening as people try to make sense of the change for themselves.

At a high level, senior leaders in the organization should focus on:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Leading the Business: </b>Making complex trade-off decisions on the future direction of the enterprise as a whole and planning across multiple time horizons; connecting future outcomes with short-term imperatives,  (e.g., what decisions are required and what leadership style is needed, recognizing that different organizations and different parts of the organization may be in different places and need different approaches).</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Leading People: </b>Galvanizing individual and collective effort behind shared goals, (e.g., what has the new situation exposed about current leaders, their capabilities, and how they deal with adversity? Does the new situation mean looking at the succession plan differently?)</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Leading Self: </b>Focusing on one’s own energy and capabilities; developing resilience and building new skills, (e.g., if the leader’s typical influencing approach is achieved through charisma, proximity, water-cooler moments; how to achieve the same results when the normal tools have gone?)</li>
</ul>
Taken together, this builds a framework that can make sense of the challenge and help leaders take practical action to manage the transition during crisis and disruption. This is visualized in the <a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/sites/default/files/content/leadership_table2.png">nine-box grid</a>, which aligns the head, heart, and hands focus with the <i>leading self</i>,<i> leading people</i>, and <i>leading business</i> levels of leadership impact. While it is populated with illustrative actions, it cannot hope to be exhaustive.

We have, however, leveraged our extensive knowledge of leading in times of crisis in order to create useful and action-oriented blog posts for our community.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As we deal with the issues of systemic racism and unjust deaths by police officers during a pandemic (as if COVID-19 all of sudden took a break), there are some things to be mindful of to help cope during these times.
<h3>Acknowledge Its Existence</h3>
We have to stop behaving as if this isn’t happening or it is just a moment in time (as much as many of us want to). There is complexity to our current environment that is specific to us, regardless of our profession—be it doctor, lawyer, professor, teacher, social worker, bus driver, or even furloughed or unemployed. There are stipulations put on you that require both acceptance and acknowledgement. I have always termed it “the game.” Dianne Feinstein did too. She said: “Learn the rules of the game. And then you have to play it better than everyone else.” You must acknowledge where you are today and what is going on. And do it everywhere: acknowledge what is going on in all the circles you exist in, not just the ones at home. Your work circles, prayer circles, friends, family—all should be aware of what is going on with you and in your world these days. Acknowledge your own situation, make sure you are clear on how you are feeling today, and accept that you will continue to need to learn and adjust.
<h3>Do Something Healthy</h3>
Being relegated to staying at home for the last few months has its issues. Many of us have gotten into a pattern of getting up, working, eating, watching TV, then repeating the process the next day. Whether you are home alone or with a full family, we still need to monitor our health during these times. COVID-19 and racism in America are not the reason you gained 15 pounds. Find a healthy behavior. Go for socially distanced walks, dust off that workout equipment you bought years ago, meditate (there are apps for that), change your eating habits, or read a book. In stressful times, we need healthy habits in order to break the monotony and help us recharge our energy.
<h3>Check on Your Friends</h3>
Many are struggling during these times with stressors that go far beyond what some of us can imagine. Some have been furloughed, others are just waiting for the announcement to happen at their place of employment, while others have lost family members and could not attend a funeral to start the grieving and healing process. Be reminded that some have responsibilities beyond just taking care of themselves—they might be in charge of aging parents, have children, or be the key financial source for multiple family members. We depended on many of the services that are no longer available during this time. We are now parent, teachers, and caretakers while also being spouses, psychologists, pastors, and friends (not to mention whatever profession we’re in). Check on the important people in your life and get a real update. Send a text or make a phone call to those in your circle. Zoom meetings and other online forums are perfect for this. Celebrate a birthday, have a happy hour, or watch your guilty pleasure reality TV show together. Make sure others know you are there for them just as much as you also need those interactions to stay sane.

In the end, this is really just the beginning for many. Know that your health is important. Know that you are not alone and that we can all come out of this healthy and better. See you on a Zoom call soon.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Two key factors are greatly influencing pandemic responses and outcomes across the globe: culture and leadership style. As businesses begin to reopen and return to “normal” operations, it’s vital they understand the roles that <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">culture and leadership</a> play in doing so seamlessly and effectively.
<h2>COVID-19 AND LEADERSHIP AROUND THE WORLD</h2>
The first step is to understand that different countries around the world have responded differently to COVID-19 due to underlying cultural factors. Although no culture is perfect, some countries are clearly faring better in their pandemic responses on key health markers. We can also imagine that they will do better on economic markers as they return to normal.

In terms of the country rankings, the U.S. leads in case rate increases, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, and the UK (Johns Hopkins University, June 22, 2020). On the other side of the coin, most Asian and African nations have done well in their mitigation efforts, with only South Africa appearing in the top 20 nations in case rates. The cultural and leader-style factors that appear to be critical for a positive or negative outcome on COVID-19 case rates are:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Independence and autonomy (U.S., UK, India)</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Independence and autocracy (Russia, Brazil)</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Consensus and interdependence (Asia, Africa)</li>
</ul>
From this, we understand that countries with high levels of independence coupled with an autocratic or populist leader style have had worse outcomes in the pandemic regarding case rates and, to some degree, death rates (The U.S., Brazil, and the UK lead the world in COVID-19 deaths).

What does this have to do with business? First, businesses and leaders exist and develop within a cultural context. Therefore, culture informs how leaders think and respond to a variety of situations, including the changes to their business caused by the pandemic. Second, we can point to research (GLOBE study, 1999, see table below) that suggests certain types of leadership characteristics are valued across all cultures and, when leveraged appropriately, create better outcomes during a crisis or when coming out of it.

What should businesses avoid? Top-down strategies developed by small groups of senior leaders are less likely to unearth, be aware of, or adequately plan for the unique circumstances of specific segments of their employee populations who are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19.

To be specific, emphasizing more values-based and team-oriented leadership has proven to be more effective than more autonomous (independent) or autocratic leadership styles. Values-based and team-oriented leadership styles foster a higher degree of collective and inclusive work, shared idea creation, and buy-in, which are assets at any time but appear especially important during these times. Conversely, leaders must be wary of cultural and stylistic factors that have set countries back during this pandemic and should actively avoid employing them as they reopen their businesses.
<h2>VALUES-BASED AND TEAM-ORIENTED BUSINESS LEADERSHIP</h2>
As companies design their return-to-work strategies, increasing employee engagement and productivity will weigh heavily in plans. Leveraging the tenets of values-based and team-oriented leadership can be a catalyst for improving both areas.

Specifically, this means creating an inclusive environment that highlights and leverages the value of a diverse range of voices. This enables greater participation in and ownership of solution development, which is critical given the complexity of the decisions being made, coupled with the high potential for unintended consequences going unseen in the rush to get back open.

So, what can you do to create concrete action based on value-based and team-oriented leadership? Below are some examples of short-term and long-term actions that can enable better outcomes for businesses navigating in a crisis.
<h3>Immediate action:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Leverage Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). Companies should look to target ERGs, frontline workers, and hourly workers who may have been disproportionately impacted in the crisis to better understand the impacts of work and COVID-19 on their personal and professional lives, including their ability to return to work.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Cast a wide net. It’s important to talk to a wide variety of the employee population, outside of just leadership, in order to get a comprehensive and accurate view of the situation and how it will impact each team and department.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Employ key data. A key tool in a company’s toolkit is the data and facts. It is critical that the data being used be leveraged in a very transparent manner to inform and reassure employees about the steps the organization is undertaking.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Level set. According to recent polls, the majority of workers are in no rush to return to their workplaces. Communication transparency will be important to ensure that all teams, across all levels, are on the same page about the situation and are informed about any changes that will be implemented.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Longer-term:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Create more diverse teams at the top. Diverse boards and diverse leadership teams ensure that a broad spectrum of voices are not only represented but also are being heard at senior levels of an organization. These diverse voices add to the perspectives and ideas in the room and also when sufficiently represented in the room, can influence decision-making outcomes that produce better social and financial results for the business.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Leverage ERGs to solve business problems. As a general resource, ERGs are underleveraged by businesses. We have identified the necessity of utilizing them in our immediate efforts related to COVID-19 reopening plans, but they represent unique perspectives that would be beneficial in solving any business problems longer term.
​</li>
</ul>
Taking action such as the ones outlined above will set companies apart and propel their reopening plans ahead of those that do not. This is truly the benefit of having a culture that amplifies a broad array of perspectives to enable decision-making and planning.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At RHR, we believe in the power of authenticity. We believe that respecting and engaging with one another’s authentic and diverse selves enables both our colleagues and clients to leverage their strengths and achieve their full potential.

After 75+ years of leadership consulting, we believe great leadership has principles of diversity, belonging, and inclusion is woven into its very core. A diverse culture is strong, innovative, and high-performing. Therefore, our DIB focus is toward both our internal practices and the services we deliver to companies across the globe. How we got here is important, and we believe our journey has taught us a great deal about how to eradicate prejudice and discrimination.
<h2>Our Journey</h2>
As a firm, we have been good people: socially liberal, fiscally conservative, and deeply psychological. We have an incredible sense of pride in our history, and more importantly, have established ourselves as a highly credible and impactful leadership consultancy. Our clients depend on us to help them resolve their most complex leadership challenges within the senior executive space. We have evolved many times, surviving big economic challenges, an aggressively competitive market, and the ongoing transformation toward online and digital. However, I wanted more, and I believed we could be more.

As I moved into the CEO role, our mission and purpose became so much more important for me personally as a driver of our business. I believe that we are here to shape leaders and leadership, but more importantly, that we can have a meaningful impact on the world through the people we work with. As such, I asked my team to help me integrate Diversity &amp; Inclusion throughout our entire organization. Even if I wasn’t sure of our endpoint, I understood that we could not deliver on our purpose or our growth goals without ensuring that leadership within our firm and in our clients was more representative of the diverse and global world.

We started with an aspirational <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">philosophy</a> about who we wanted to be to ourselves and to our clients. Our initial goal was to work through our own biases and assumptions, holding ourselves to a high standard and understanding and acknowledging the complex historical context of race and ethnicity in order to nurture and support diversity. As many of you have likely found in your own organizations, no matter your positive intentions, building self-awareness and understanding our own individual relationship with discrimination and prejudice is an incredibly uncomfortable and difficult but worthwhile journey. This has challenged everything we took for granted for ourselves as a firm and forced us to consider the development we needed to undertake to meet our own aspirational philosophy.
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Internal Self-Assessment and Action</h2>
We approach self-assessment on a company-wide level, looking at our own internal practices and culture to see how we may be inhibiting effective work with diverse communities and each other. We hold ourselves accountable across the board to model inclusive behavior. This includes:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Putting the right people in place to lead this work. We needed the right balance of deep commercial and research-based experience, and I needed strong strategic partners who could drive toward my big vision. Cristina Jimenez and Lawrence James were perfect for transforming our firm and helping us to deliver meaningful client outcomes.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Delivering storytelling workshops to create a safe space for our consultants and staff to talk about their own unique history and diversity story. Paving the way for a deeper understanding of the ways that race, gender, sexuality, and more inform who we are and how we act is key to breaking down barriers. We focused on creating intimacy and honesty in judgment-free conversations.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Working on an individual level with our colleagues around awareness of privilege, power, and allyship. We have thought about how we define ourselves and others while expanding our understanding of cultural, gender, and racial inequalities.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Focusing on quality assurance processes for our client deliverables has allowed us to deliver unbiased reports.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Re-assessing our hiring practices to ensure they were not only inclusive but proactively sourcing diverse talent. RHR’s hiring focus resulted in an increase of 73% in people of color over three years to our current levels, increasing from 14% to 22% of our employees and 1 board member. We approached our learning as an ongoing and consistent endeavor, sharing best practices and educational materials and engaging in often honest and challenging dialogue within our teams and with our clients.</li>
</ul>
We know that there is more work to be done and true systemic change happens when this becomes less about work and more about creating norms around candor, compassion, and courage. We can and must do better! At RHR, we are dedicated to continuous learning and development in order to ensure that we make a tangible and vital change in ourselves first, but also with the leaders, cultures, and the world, we interact with. The conversation is far from over, and we are ready to continue taking action now and in the future.

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the past week or so, I have received numerous texts from my white coworkers, friends, and mentors with the same sentiment: what can I do to help? At first, I didn’t want to respond to the question because there are so many things you can do as an ally, but it will take work and the ability to examine yourself with a lens you have never used before. But if you are up for the task, then it can be a journey that will make you a better person. Here are just a few things to consider.
<h2>Am I an “ally” everywhere?</h2>
Yes, this first question is the cornerstone of “allyship” (not sure if that is a word but work with me here). Many of us know how easy it is to say, “I am here for you” or “I support you,” but the key to that is to ask yourself, “do I really?” Does your allyship show up in your own friendships? If you are an executive at your company, <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">are your teams diverse?</a> And no, you can’t hit me with the “I support diverse thinking” statement. You know what I mean here. Do you have culturally diverse members on your team? Do you look for diversity when filling a new role? Do you require your recruiters to present a diverse slate of candidates each time? We all have seen the countless studies that conclude: the more diverse team you have, the better the results for the business. Yet we still see that minority representation at the most senior level is a problem we report on every day. And instead of making that an issue we attribute to CEOs around the globe, just start with the world, you control—you. Does your allyship show up by promoting diversity where you control it? Are you open to the places where it does not, and will you take steps to complete the tasks of being an ally? I know, there are so many questions to answer in just this one question, but the goal of understanding what you can do as an ally is to first examine where you are on the spectrum. If we can get your help to be an ally everywhere, then it is the start of a beautiful relationship.
<h2>Am I educated on the topic?</h2>
Now, it is easy to say that you “understand” that racism is a problem. But do you really? It is important that you get educated on the issues. And this may be the easiest of all the things I say here. Educate yourself on the issues of racism in this country. Understand that there are privileges that you have that others do not. You are not to feel bad because you have them. No one is trying to denigrate you for that, but realize that your privilege exists. We all have privileges that others don’t, even within races. There are some things I am privileged to that other black men are not. I have to recognize that for myself just as I ask you to recognize yours. So get educated. There are tons of books and research on these issues. There are videos and documentaries that help to explain some of the topics. These issues are American and part of the fabric of our country. Lastly, ask the hard questions of your black friends. Trust me, many are used to it and would rather educate you on issues than leave you out there hanging. But know you are getting the answer from their perspective and not from an entire race. No one black person speaks for us all. But ask the questions and learn something.
<h2>What actions do I take?</h2>
I think the action to be taken at this time in America is to commit to the solution. This is not a flash-in-time issue or something that will get fixed shortly. This wound is deep and will take therapy and other remedies to help heal this country from what is referred to as “America’s Original Sin.” Action and commitment are necessary. Consider the places where you have an unfair advantage and see how you can make it fair for others. Look at your school districts, libraries, public transportation, etc. It is not just an economic issue. Look to see where you have avoided these topics and dive in with energy. Make sure that you support diversity in a manner that is core to your being and not the popular thing to do. There will be a plethora of places where we can address racism and plenty of areas that need your skill and help. Commit to it and be unapologetic that it is core to your beliefs.

Okay, I think that is the start. I don’t want to overwhelm you with action items and questions. If you can answer these first three and join the millions around the country who are saying “Black Lives Matter,” then your allyship is confirmed. Just remember the work is arduous and will oftentimes force you to confront issues that have been core to your identity. It is doing that for all of us. Stay in the fight and help eradicate racism for good.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The current COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges for <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-founder/">boards and management teams</a>. Every organization has been wrestling with how the health and economic crisis have impacted their company, including the way the board and management team have navigated the threats and opportunities. A recent <a href="https://boardmember.com/the-new-normal-in-governance-a-paradigm-shift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Corporate Board Member article</a> highlighted the ways some boards have responded to these challenges. One recommendation the directors who were interviewed offered is to conduct an after-action review of the board and management team’s responses to the COVID crisis. One approach to doing this is to incorporate the review into the board’s annual evaluation process. Here are some suggestions about how to do that.
<h2>What to Include in the Board Evaluation</h2>
A standard board evaluation, to be thorough, should include inquiry about each dimension of governance that contributes to the effective discharge of a board’s oversight responsibility. The blog below outlines seven areas to include in an annual <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/evaluating-your-board-seven-areas-to-assess/">board evaluation</a>.

With the unique circumstances presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, this year’s evaluation of these dimensions can be conducted through a lens focused on how effectively the board functioned in meeting the challenges posed by the pandemic. Here are a few areas for the board to examine:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">What value did the company need our board to contribute, and how well did we deliver that value?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What did the pandemic teach us about our company’s strategy, business model, capital structure, and supply chain dependencies?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What, if any, adjustments need to be made in our company’s emergency preparedness?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Are our IT infrastructure and cybersecurity protections adequate for what we will need in the future?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What have we learned about the strengths and development needs of mission-critical talent?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What have we learned about the strengths and development implications for our board’s composition? (E.g., requisite expertise and acumen relevant to our business or strength of the director’s networks to access resources on behalf of the company.)</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What are the lessons we can apply in the future about our board’s culture and how we communicated and made decisions in a virtual operating mode?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Process Recommendations</h2>
First and foremost, as with any standard board evaluation, ensuring the utmost candor from directors is critical. Whether performed by a lead director, nominating and governance committee chair, or an outside facilitator, board members must feel that their evaluation input will be kept in confidence. Given that board evaluations, this year will most likely need to be conducted virtually rather than in-person, the video or audio technology selected must be completely secure.

Second, it is recommended that confidential management input be included from those members of the management team who have interacted with the board and its committees. That input can be collected through both an online survey and interviews conducted by the point person doing the evaluation.

Third, it is recommended that self-evaluation be completed by each director assessing how they contributed during the year and how they might add more value in the future.

Finally, the board should discuss the results of the evaluation, identify action steps for the future, and build a follow-up process to track the execution of the action steps.

Implementing these recommendations will enable a board to do a <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-founder/">meaningful assessment of both its strengths and opportunities</a> to further its value and contribution in guiding and overseeing the organization it is charged with directing.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Some years ago, when virtual teaming was a fad rather than a necessity, I happened to come across a doctoral thesis on virtual teams. After three years of sweat and toil, the erstwhile student had summed up their work with the phrase “distance amplifies dysfunction”. My immediate reaction was that it seemed a blindingly obvious conclusion; however, as we now move into an uncertain but hopefully post-COVID world, "distance amplifies dysfunction" keeps bubbling back into my consciousness. We have all experienced distance in some way—being physically apart, psychologically disconnected, divested from our old regimes and habits, or separated from customers, clients, and for some of us, reality! So, have we experienced the worst of the dysfunction, or is there more to come?

It is clear when we look across our client base that many are moving out of crisis mode and looking for new opportunities that have emerged during the pandemic as they consider a post-COVID future. CEOs and executive teams are feverishly working to prepare for this new order by conducting after-action reviews and scenario planning strategies, processes, structures, and talent requirements. While speed is of the essence, many are holding back, feeling it is too early to pivot and change direction because more data is needed. Nevertheless, there is something senior executive teams should be doing—using this time of enforced distancing to look at their own ability to work as a team and forensically analyze their own performance, surfacing any signs of dysfunction and laying the foundation for success going forward. It is what we call helping teams live and understand their new story.
<h2>Helping to define a new story</h2>
When considering <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-teams/">executive teams</a>, what distinguishes a good team from the highest performing team is their ability to define what they do, how they do it, who they are, and why this is important. The words what, how, who, and why may be simple, but they act as a powerful compass pointing the way to superior performance.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-1666 size-full" src="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/STE.png" alt="" width="458" height="326" />

Having a compass is essential in unchartered waters, but as any seafaring person knows, there is a constant need to make shifts and adjustments based on the wind. We are arguably now in one of the biggest storms of a generation, and executive teams are needing to move like never before, quickly learning the lessons of the past few months and shaping a new story that prepares them for the challenges ahead. Here are some of the questions to consider when helping top teams shape their new story.

The <b>What</b> is the work of the team and how it is changing.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Have our priorities changed?</b> Just as importantly, <b>what has not changed and needs to be reinforced?</b> Teams should be all over this, but the lens has narrowed, and while hunkering down in crisis mode, it can be easy to lose sight and alignment on what is really important; in particular, focusing on the mid-to-long-term priorities. Using a simple straw poll, on Zoom, for example, can reveal if there is alignment and clarity on the priorities and also whether there is the confidence that the priorities will drive success.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Is the team fit for purpose?</b> As executive teams look forward, it would be beneficial to examine what talent emerged in the group. Where did a lack of experience and knowledge expose the team and was there a lack of capability? One way to do this is to see where the team needed to leverage advisors internally or externally. Will this skillset be needed in the future?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Are the team aligned around a shared agenda and how is this changing?</b> The shared agenda should drive where the team invests its time and energy. A good example is safety and employee well-being. This has now catapulted up the priority list and firmly sits with the executive team, yet many executive teams see this as HR’s responsibility and are either not aligned or do not give it the time and space in the agenda that it deserves.</li>
</ul>
The <b>How</b> is the team operating together (their written and unwritten operating principles)—how it makes decisions, how often it meets, how it gives feedback, and how it manages itself when there is pressure. The general consensus is that, despite the amount of Zoom fatigue (yes, this is now a recognized condition), teams are fully embracing virtual working. However, there are important questions to consider in this regard.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>What are teams learning about decision-making? </b>One client had been discussing a global platform for two years and had never moved beyond stifling debates. Then the crisis struck, and it moved ahead in two weeks. Every organization has examples like this. Spend time unpacking these obstacles to the decision-making process in your company, identify how decision-making authority changes, and determine how to implement better processes that can make a real difference in the future.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>In what ways do the team norms need to change?</b> Operating in a virtual environment is changing the way we run our meetings; however, a broader discussion on the written and unwritten rules of the team and how have they been demonstrated can still prove enlightening. With one of my clients, their norm of scrutiny—when overzealously applied—created a culture of holding back bad news. They soon realized that in times of uncertainty, innovation and opportunities are often borne out of such information. Also, if new norms are agreed upon, watch for old habits creeping back in and not being checked or pointed out.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Is the team open and candid with their feedback?</b> This is not a strong muscle for many teams, especially executive teams; however, giving the space for reflection and the opportunity to share feedback, particularly under these unprecedented times, is a powerful way to build trust. Strangely and hopefully, we are now finding that working virtually with teams, people are more likely to share direct, tougher feedback by video!</li>
</ul>
The <b>Who</b> is the people that make up the team. It relates to the team dynamics, the personality and cognitive styles of the team, and the culture they create. Everyone on the team will have been impacted in some way by distance, so giving people the chance to get in touch with this, without making assumptions, is key.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Take time for personal reflection. </b>Ask team members to share their own personal journey during the pandemic and how it will shape them going forward. Having the group share this with each other is a powerful tool to re-establish and build a deep level of trust. It also provides a library of stories that can be used to motivate others in the organization.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Look to <b>harness conflict in a positive way</b> in order to leverage tension that drives different perspectives. We know high-performing teams are good at this, being adept at harnessing tension to drive vociferous debate. As teams return, they need to guard against the metaphorical “group hug” for managing the crisis and “smoothing over cracks”, when in reality, it is the cracks that will help identify opportunities for change.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Take the opportunity to articulate and <b>define the culture of the team</b> that is needed post-pandemic. There are heroes in all parts of the organization and within the team that exemplify agility, resilience, and a “no surprise” culture. It is important to call these behaviors out and be clear about the culture you want to create.</li>
</ul>
The <b>Why</b> is the philosophical heartbeat—why the things we are doing are important and what binds the team together. Often teams confuse this with delivering on the strategy when it is actually much more than just a goal.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Agree on the team's purpose.</b> It should resonate with the team and feel inspired. For many, the current environment has led them to question their own purpose, which is a great springboard to open the discussion. Purpose-led leadership is needed now more than ever.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Articulate the why </b>of the team to others. As Simon Sinek says, people do not buy <i>what</i> you do; they buy <i>why</i> you do it.</li>
</ul>
Helping teams move from an old story to a news story is not a new exercise, but in the current environment where so much is unknown and changing, this <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-teams/">helps executive teams</a> focus on the one thing that is in their control—themselves.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As the coronavirus makes its way across the globe, nearly every person and every business on the planet has been impacted. Since 1945, when the Second World War ended and RHR International was founded, the consultants in our firm have worked with our clients to assist them in seizing the opportunities and meeting the challenges inherent in leading their organizations. Throughout the decades, those leaders have had to navigate their businesses through a number of highly disruptive events including wars, terrorist attacks, and financial swings, along with the accompanying mercurial and rapidly changing markets. Given the unprecedented disruption in the world precipitated by Covid-19, we thought it important to examine how the pandemic is impacting the way boards are operating in the current context and how that may change in the future.

To better understand how the pandemic is impacting boards, we invited input from some of our client directors. The directors we interviewed were a highly experienced group who currently serve on or have served on the boards of more than 60 companies, ranging from Fortune 500 global organizations to midsized and start-up firms across more than a dozen different sectors. We asked those directors to share their perspectives on two questions:
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1">How have the value proposition and contribution a board needs to deliver been changed by the pandemic?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Are there any differences in how individual directors need to contribute? (I.e., how are the requirements and desired capabilities for directors changing?)</li>
</ol>
What follows is a summary of the responses offered by those directors.
<h2>Differing Impacts and Common Responses</h2>
Affirming the framework offered by RHR’s David Astorino, PsyD, MBA, and Val Nellen, Ph.D., in their <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/the-new-normal-is-now/">The New Normal is Now</a> article, several of the directors noted that different companies are being impacted differently by the pandemic. In that framework, three modes of impact are described:
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1">Crisis mode (extreme disruption of supply and/or demand)</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Weathering the storm (some disruption requiring short-term adaptations)</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Capitalizing mode (new opportunities have been presented)</li>
</ol>
The focus of the directors we spoke with varied depending upon whether the companies they were governing were struggling for existential survival (e.g., retailers, some energy companies, travel, and hospitality) or determining how to capitalize on new opportunities presented by the pandemic (e.g., consumer packaged goods (CPG) food, online businesses, and some pharma companies).

“All businesses have been impacted but to meaningfully different degrees. Some are facing mortal threat while others are looking at opportunities,” said Archie van Beuren, chair of the governance committee at Campbell Soup Company and vice chairman of Brandywine Trust Group

Whether in crisis mode, weathering the storm, or capitalizing mode, the directors we spoke with were unanimous about how the pandemic was changing the governance cadence and focus. The commonalities include:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">An overarching priority on the health and safety of the workforce</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">The imperative to aid and support management</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">More frequent interactions among board members and with management teams</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">All meetings and contacts being done virtually</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">A sharpening of the focus, intensity, directness, and candor in dialogue</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">The impact of working remotely on board and company culture</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">The need to consistently confirm the viability of the strategy and speed of decisions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Some director perspectives:</h2>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">“First and foremost, we are focused on the health and safety of our workers.” <i>– </i>Jack Liebau, chairman of the board at Myers Industries, Inc. and director at S3 Software</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">“The board’s objectives in discussing issues and <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-founder/">giving guidance to succession planning</a> are more difficult to accomplish [via virtual platforms], and going forward, it will change board composition to have directors who can act more independently and remotely.” – James V. Rosati, board member of Delta Dental Rhode Island, Avadim Health, Inc., Uncas International, The Miriam Hospital Foundation, and member of Bryant University Board of Trustees</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">“One thing I have seen is a level of intensity that has kicked up. We are having way more frequent meetings and discussions.” – Alan Wilson, former chairman, and chief executive officer of McCormick &amp; Company, Inc. and lead director of T. Rowe Price and WestRock</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">“We are seeing companies stressed in one way or another. We are there to provide support. If you believe there are times for special committees, now the board is one big special committee.” – Howard Brownstein, director at P&amp;F Industries, Inc. and Merakey</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">“We are even more focused on purpose and what makes the company distinct. We have spent more time on culture and HR in the last six weeks than I ever have in the boardroom.”  — Fabiola Arrendola, board member at Burberry Group, Campbell Soup, National Public Radio, and FICO</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implications for Directors</h2>
The board members we interviewed had a lot to say about the demands being placed on directors currently and how they need to step up to those demands. There was unanimous agreement that directors need to be extremely well-informed about the business of the organization in order to add value during fast-paced, highly focused interactions. It was also mentioned by many directors that broad and deep business experience, particularly in operations, finance, and HR, is particularly valuable in these times. <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-assessment/">Directors who have only been exposed to a single organization in their careers may not have the perspective needed to provide insightful counsel.</a>

Comfort with ambiguity and an extensive network of contacts who can access resources on behalf of the organization were also cited as important attributes. When videoconferencing is the medium for board and committee meetings, high levels of trust and transparency and the ability to be simultaneously direct and collegial were seen as critical attributes. These qualities are challenging to convey without the nonverbal cues that in-person contact enables. The intensity and demands of board service now require high levels of physical and emotional energy along with patience.
<h2>Some director perspectives:</h2>
“We need well-rounded directors who can operate collegially—IQ and EQ. No one hijacks the agenda. Tenure is more important than age, and directors need a much deeper understanding of the board materials to contribute to direct, fast-paced discussions.” –Rick Lenny, non-executive board chair at ConAgra Foods, current board member at McDonald’s, and former CEO of The Hershey Company

“The board’s objectives in discussing issues and giving guidance to succession planning are more difficult to accomplish [via virtual platforms], and going forward, it will change board composition to have directors who can act more independently and remotely.” –James Rosati, board member of Delta Dental of Rhode Island, The Beacon Mutual Insurance Company, Avadim Health, Uncas Manufacturing Company, and The Miriam Hospital
<h2>Governance in the Future</h2>
Although the core role of a board will remain essentially the same—i.e., to ensure the company’s prosperity by collectively directing the company’s affairs while meeting the appropriate interests of its shareholders and relevant stakeholders—aspects of how boards discharge that role are changing. The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in companies, which boards are currently leaning into and will need to better anticipate and prepare for in the future. Certainly, online board meetings will continue for the foreseeable future. Many directors commented about the efficiency of virtual meetings and how much time and wear and tear are saved by not having to travel for in-person meetings. There is no question that boards need to increase preparedness for disruptive scenarios. As Ramon de Oliveira, who chairs the boards of AllianceBernstein and Equitable Holdings and is a director at AXA, put it: “It’s not about guessing the future. It’s about building scenarios—that’s the most important job a board can do. And then figure out what operating strategies a company can put in place in each scenario.”

Also, the speed with which the coronavirus struck underscores the need for a board to be able to pivot quickly. Doug Conant, the former CEO of Campbell Soup Company, former board chair of Avon, and a current board member at RHR International, offered this view: “Boards and directors will need to become more agile. Warren Bennis used the term VUCA—volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. Now the world is VUCA on steroids!”

Directors in the future will need to be curious, courageous, and willing to speak their minds. They need to be willing to deal with ambiguity, listen and be able to process different perspectives. If the world is changing, directors can’t stick with their preconceived views of the world. Bob Eckert, a director at Levi Strauss &amp; Co., Amgen, Uber, and McDonald’s, offered the following insights:

“I see this crisis playing out in three stages. The first phase is crisis mode, then the restart phase—which we are currently in—and the third phase is when we ask what the new normal will be and what changes will we need in our operating model, infrastructure, and supply chain. There will be opportunities for big bets. One of my board colleagues boils down a board’s role to three important tasks: 1) making sure the best leadership of the company is in place and being developed; 2) making sure there is a winning strategy in place; and 3) making sure the proper safeguards to manage risks are in place. Due to the pandemic, <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-teams/">discussions between board and management on these topics are all changing</a>—the discussions are bigger, deeper, and more important than ever.”

The directors we interviewed stressed the importance of extracting lessons learned during this time of crisis. Several emphasized the importance of using the annual board evaluation process to do this and to examine how the board needs to operate differently in the future. Deborah Hall Lefevre, a board member at Wintrust, recommended conducting after-action reviews of emergency response plans and making sure that succession plans are in place. Directors also noted that there are implications for the board’s responsibility to ensure that strong talent management and succession planning are in place. The current leadership demands are revealing some exceptionally capable talent on management teams as well as exposing some weaknesses. As part of their review processes, boards need to make sure management teams are doing all they can to retain the company’s best talent and should consider what revisions might be needed in succession plans for mission-critical roles.

Aida Álvarez, who is a current director of HP Inc., Oportun, and Fastly; a former director of Walmart; and the former cabinet-level secretary of the Small Business Administration in the Clinton administration, thinks the current pandemic has ushered in a new chapter in corporate governance when she says: “This has unearthed weaknesses and strengths. There is a paradigm shift for everyone—how government and business partner and how the whole interdependent ecosystem must function given the interdependence among the component parts.”

As RHR’s Joanna Starek, Ph.D., described in a recent Corporate Board Member post <a href="https://boardmember.com/twenty-first-century-leadership-for-twenty-first-century-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twenty-First Century Leadership for Twenty-First Century Problems</a>: “We are globally-connected, and we have the tools to bring all of human ingenuity and brilliance to bear to thrive in new and unique ways. The challenge is to eradicate old mindsets and embrace new solutions.”

Boards in the future need to seize the opportunity to work in partnership with their management teams to realize that challenge.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the disturbing events of the past week in the U.S., I write with a heavy heart and lots of anger and frustration. Across the country, people are horrified by the recent killings of three African Americans: Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and George Floyd. And these are only a few of the most recent deaths to cause particular anguish among those who far too long have endured indignity after indignity. As I have reflected over the past few days about the unnecessary, brutal, and hatred-driven murder of George Floyd, I try to comprehend how this happened, and continues to happen, in a so-called evolved society. The expanding protests and unrest across the U.S. are symbolic of a huge cry for help and of a need for something to change. This never-ending racism and unnecessary police violence against people of color need to stop. We need leaders who are aware, empathetic, and trustworthy now more than ever. We all need to do better—policymakers, police organizations, and leaders like you and me. This is not a political issue; it’s a humanity issue, and if we can’t get this right, the pain and suffering will be endless. I don’t pretend to have all the answers to extinguish hatred and deep-seated racism, but I do know <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">we all have a role to help educate and change the world</a> through our personal lives and the work we do at RHR.

RHR condemns racism, oppression, and senseless violence targeted toward minorities. I can’t tell you what to do during these times, but taking constructive action in your own way and taking some responsibility to have uncomfortable, open conversations about what is currently happening with colleagues, friends, and family would be a productive start. I have to imagine this is also weighing heavy within your own organizations. This generation and the generations that follow are key to helping break this long-standing string of hatred, racism, and targeted violence toward people of color in the U.S. In times like this, it is difficult to feel optimistic, and it is too easy to feel hopeless and give up. We cannot let that happen. Being courageous and standing up for human rights is of paramount importance. Let’s do what we can individually and collectively to help eradicate this senseless hatred and violence.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Being a leader is a lonely job under the best of circumstances. Forging close friendships with work colleagues isn’t part of a CEO’s remit, nor should it be. Even executives who are committed to inclusive and transparent leadership understand that the unique demands of running an organization require a certain degree of circumspection. During a crisis, communicating with the right blend of candor, optimism, and urgency while preserving the optionality to make tough decisions becomes an exponentially more challenging needle for leaders to thread.

In order to authentically convey the <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-teams/">empathy and resilience their teams are counting on</a>, wartime leaders need an external support system they can lean into to maintain their equanimity. There’s no substitute, of course, for the foundational role family and friends play in that ecosystem. Many executives also engage mentors, coaches, therapists, and other trusted advisors to help them focus on targeted professional and personal growth objectives. These relationships can be powerful catalysts for achieving positive change as well as stabilizing forces in turbulent times.

Some leaders choose to supplement or substitute, these one-on-one development activities with participation in peer forums. Whether organic and informal or curated and professionally facilitated, these small networks, which are typically capped at 10–12 members, offer several benefits:
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1">The opportunity to constructively brainstorm, problem-solve, strategize, and recharge in the company of trusted equals rather than in “boss” mode, which can turbocharge the positive growth process.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">A safe space to develop self-awareness, gain a greater appreciation of one’s strengths, and explore gaps and blind spots.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">The ability to <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-assessment/">normalize common leadership struggles as inevitable and universal</a>, rather than tribulations caused by personal shortcomings.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">An invaluable source of moral support, inspiration, accountability, professional introductions, and friendship.</li>
</ol>
Over time, as members develop a deeper understanding of one another and their respective businesses, these networks become formidable sounding boards and knowledge-transfer conduits, not to mention welcome opportunities to “get out of one’s head” and derive satisfaction from helping others resolve thorny challenges. Relating to and empathizing with the experiences of other successful executives is often a freeing shift in perspective for leaders who are accustomed to feeling that the burdens they bear are unique.
<h2>When you don't have a playbook, brain trust is the next best thing.</h2>
A couple of weeks into the COVID-19 lockdown, members of a C-suite peer group who had been meeting on a monthly basis in Manhattan for over a year, connected for their first virtual session. Despite their different industries—including retail, publishing, and professional services—the updates they shared were variations on a similar theme: “We are scrambling to figure out how to creatively redeploy our employees and pivot on the fly; who knows if our products and services will still be relevant when we emerge from this; more furloughs and layoffs are inevitable, and I still haven’t recovered from the first round; I’m really proud of the way my team members are rising to the occasion, but we’re all exhausted and it feels like things will get worse before they get better.” Partners, kids, and pets wandered in and out of the frame as the group shifted into workshopping mode. At the end of the two-hour conversation, everyone left with concrete strategies and resources to throw at their most urgent problem, and several of the executives mentioned how much better and more energized they felt. They agreed to meet again in two weeks’ time rather than wait a full month and to share resources that were shaping their thinking as the pandemic continued.

Recently, the group gathered for its fourth quarantine session. As in the past, members reported that they had “channeled” the voice and wisdom of specific peers as they tackled difficult challenges or operated differently. They also appreciated the value of their exchanges in between meetings, including group emails with links to topical articles and podcasts, one-on-one conversations to share specific expertise and/or referrals a member was seeking, and texts for quick check-ins and personal updates.

This time, all eight members reported that at least some of the strategic initiatives they had discussed during prior meetings and subsequently implemented were paying off. A majority also expressed optimism about what they believed would be possible going forward now that they had sacrificed so many of the sacred cows that governed both what and how things got done in their respective companies. Kudos were exchanged, questions and ideas were shared, and then members signed off to tackle another day in the trenches, buoyed by the collective energy of the group.

The ability to celebrate wins, commiserate over losses, get cheered on when the going is tough, and be held to actions that represent the best versions of ourselves—by people who understand exactly what we are going through—is something we all crave. So while it will inevitably feel lonely at the top, and at times exhausting and all-consuming, <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-founder/">leaders</a> who surround themselves with wise fellow travelers who are navigating the same path are never truly alone.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you wonder what chief executive officers are thinking right now, here is a small window into those conversations. Recently, RHR International facilitated conversations with groups of CEOs from different industries. The purpose was to allow CEOs to share ideas and to calibrate their thoughts about reopening after the COVID-19 shutdown. As the CEOs started sharing, it quickly became obvious not every industry sector is in the same place. Some companies are fighting for survival, others are weathering the storm, and a third group is thriving due to new, unexpected opportunities. Regardless of circumstance, the tone of the conversations was authentic, thoughtful, and reflective. Here are some of the topics that emerged.

<b>The Power of People:</b> Regardless of industry circumstance, <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-founder/">CEOs</a> reported the number-one highlight and lowlight of this crisis has been their employees. They have been impressed by how teams are coming together, the adaptability of the workforce, the commitment to doing the right thing, and the care with which employees are treating one another. The lowlights have been the gut-wrenching decisions around furloughs and layoffs coupled with difficult trade-offs on how to keep people safe while keeping them employed. In the same conversation, we found leaders humbled by the weight of the tough decisions they had to make regarding employees while simultaneously being energized by the resilience of the people they work with.

<b>Acceleration of the Virtual Workforce:</b> A second theme that emerged was the fascination with how easy it was to move some parts of work to a virtual environment. The plane trips and in-person meetings that seemed so critical can be done well via video. Many employees report being more productive working at home than in the office. Others, however, find it nearly impossible, particularly the working parents and/or those in crowded living spaces. The shift also highlights that front-line workers do not have the luxury of working behind a computer screen. For CEOs, this raises questions about the workforce of the future. Will the “corporate center” ever return to the way it was? What type of new, hybrid environment should they build? Also, what are the new workers’ rights, and what policies need to be put in place to quickly <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">meet the needs of different groups in the workforce</a>?

<b>Reimagining the Future:</b> As CEOs lift out of crisis mode, they are starting to think about the future. What will be the same versus what will be different? At the most basic level, they are grappling with how fast to accelerate new strategies when keeping the business functioning is already straining attention and resources. One leader reflected: “All plans are out the window. If we have to reset our business, do we reimagine everything (e.g., our value proposition, our structure, the profit and loss statement, and the pace of innovation)?” As the CEO uttered those words, you could sense his excitement as well as the apprehension. The decisions made now have immense weight and will influence what is to come in 2021 and beyond.

<b>Managing the Political Divide:</b> An interesting theme that emerged is how to manage the current political climate related to reopening the country and the economy. Rather than solely trust government recommendations, companies are hiring their own medical consultants and/or wading through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines to determine the best path forward. The CEOs in consumer-facing industries have the added weight of trying to figure out how to keep employees and customers safe without making their company a political target. Think of the recent fiasco at Family Dollar, where violence ensued after an employee asked a customer to wear a mask. Decisions about safety become more complicated when you factor in that some will get angry if you don’t require protective masks, while others will be offended if you do. The solutions required become magnified in global environments, where policies and procedures vary from country to country.

<b>Existential Questions:</b> On the personal front, several CEOs noted how the job has become even lonelier as they lead their organizations and seek to engage their team and the broader employee base from a room in their house. Some have had a personal tragedy, losing loved ones to COVID-19. Others are sinking more deeply into “purpose” or “fitness” or “family” and are trying to make the most of the time saved by not traveling or commuting. Like many of us, they are rethinking the quality of their lives. What personal habits do they want to retain? What, if anything, has shifted in regard to personal values and personal commitments?

These conversations illuminate that the job of the CEO in today’s world is immensely complex. At the weightiest moments, leaders grapple with knowing the decisions they make impact many lives. At their lightest moments, they realize their people and teams want to rally behind positive choices and they may not be as alone as they often feel.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As the coronavirus crisis impacts our society, it creates some unique challenges for boards. One of the major issues under consideration is whether the chief executive officer who took you to this point is the same leader who can take your company through this challenge and beyond. Ultimately, leaders are judged by the way they perform during the worst of times, and the current crisis represents a challenge that no current CEO has seen previously in their careers. How CEOs and their teams perform during these moments of truth will be an unforgiving test of their character.

The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting companies in different ways. As noted in the RHR article “<a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/the-new-normal-is-now/">The New Normal Is Now</a>,” some companies are in full survival mode, some are working hard but weathering the storm, and some are experiencing a surge in demand. During these perplexing times, it behooves boards to look back to their original assumptions that formed the foundation of their <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-founder/">CEO succession process</a> and act accordingly.

Typically, when boards prepare for CEO succession, they create a leadership profile based on the company’s strategy along with the challenges and opportunities they anticipate the company will face. Some of the aspects they consider hinge on their current business trajectory, i.e., steady-state, turnaround, or rapid growth. Other considerations include their business model, the complexity of the business, their geographic footprint, and whether the focus will be on inorganic and/or organic growth. These elements and others lead to implications for the type of leadership behaviors, skillsets, and experiences necessary to be successful in the CEO role.

Of course, no candidate is a perfect match, and boards must make trade-offs to find the best fit for their company’s needs. Plus, many if not most CEOs continue to evolve and grow in the role. The key to success during these unprecedented times is to ensure that the board continues to also evolve in its understanding of the <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-assessment/">leadership that is required</a>, what they currently have in place, and the leaders, they are growing for the future.

As outlined in RHR’s <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Leadership-in-Times-of-Uncertainty.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leadership in Times of Uncertainty</a> article, leaders in times such as these need to be able to:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Inform</b> and communicate early and often with their constituents</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Connect</b> and generate trust with employees</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Guide</b> by providing clear direction on what to do</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Unite</b> their community by reinforcing what makes them unique to align action</li>
</ul>
These critical skillsets place a premium on CEOs who bring strong communication skills, have fundamental guiding value sets, can work from a range of leadership styles, and exhibit a bias for action. Boards should note whether or not their <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">senior executives demonstrate adaptability and resilience</a> in taking the lead when faced with adversity as well as the ability to architect a way forward. When challenged by daunting business circumstances, do these leaders step up or step back? And do their priorities, decisions, and pace match the business needs?

Listening skills and the ability to empathize and leverage others’ perspectives are additional critical capabilities given the complexities of the current environment. Consider:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Is your CEO the kind of leader who facilitates shared solutions or someone who believes they are the smartest person in the room?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Is your CEO someone who is still keeping an eye on the talent pipeline and seeing the chance to challenge other leaders to learn from the situation?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Are they delegating, supporting, and coaching without micromanaging?</li>
</ul>
Given the current coronavirus crisis, it is imperative for boards to step up and determine whether they should support, replace, or plan a more measured succession for the current CEO. This is also a time for companies to take stock regarding their company’s succession pipeline. Conducting a thorough scenario-planning exercise will enable boards to look at how their CEOs and mission-critical leaders stack up against the leadership requirements of those scenarios. By assessing their top talent and ensuring that feedback and coaching are provided for these leaders’ development, boards will be able to verify that the leadership is in place to help navigate toward a sustainable future for the organization and deliver on their fiduciary responsibility to their stakeholders.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In our last <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/the-nfl-versus-moneyball/">blog</a>, we discussed the National Football League’s scouting challenges and what Major League Baseball does differently to <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-assessment/">assess talent</a>. In this installment, we will outline a novel way to overcome natural bias, speed the hiring process, and improve your hit rate.

To illustrate natural bias and its consequences, Malcolm Gladwell, author and journalist pointed to what he calls "the quarterback problem." Each year, the National Football League (NFL) selects new recruits by testing college players physically and cognitively. The tests work fine for most player positions, but when it comes to quarterbacks, the most important position on the playing field, according to Gladwell, "they do an absolutely terrible job of predicting who will do well." One reason is that the size and speed of professional athletes exceeds those at the college level, so the behaviors that were successful in college don’t necessarily predict success in the NFL. Unfortunately, there’s no way to test a quarterback in real time NFL action before signing one to a sizable contract.

One might think that businesses are similarly handicapped when trying to predict which applicant or recruit will be the most successful in their new environment. But this doesn’t have to be the case. It is possible to get real-time work samples from external candidates at the managerial and executive levels by bringing them into staff meetings with potential future peers and inviting them to participate in analyzing a real-time business opportunity or issue the team is facing. Here they aren’t able to rely on a polished PowerPoint presentation they’ve had months to work on. You are able to probe their thinking and go beyond their single set of talking points that served them well in all those interviews you’ve put them through in the preceding weeks.

It’s not as difficult as it sounds. You can maintain confidentiality by simply removing any identifying information from the materials and conversation. At the end of a two-hour session, both the candidate and their potential peers and boss have a feel for what it would be like to work together. The <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-teams/">hiring team and manager have a clear sense</a> of the kind of contributions a candidate can make, how they form judgments, and whether they can keep up with the rest of the team. Just as importantly, real-time impressions of their personal manner and fit with the culture become evident. This is key, because after all, there is some truth in the old adage that people are hired for their knowledge and fired for their personality.

So, when hiring your next key player, you needn’t be hamstrung by lack of data as to how they will fit in with the team and organization. You can cut down the number of unpleasant surprises and disappointments by inviting those finalist candidates who make it through vital initial screening interviews to join you on the playing field in grappling with real-time issues and content. You can also pare down the serial interview process by getting candidates to the meeting room sooner. So, selecting talent is now a dimension on which your organization can significantly outperform the National Football League.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Establishing a positive connection between the board and the CEO is never more important than when onboarding a new chief executive officer. Actions taken during the first few weeks and months of a new CEO’s tenure will establish the groundwork for a successful ongoing relationship. Here are some tips for getting off to a fast start.
<ol>
 	<li><b> Provide feedback regarding the hiring process: </b>Both the selection criteria and job description for the CEO position should be discussed directly with the new CEO. Framed correctly, feedback about the CEO’s fit with those role requirements can help level-set expectations and get the relationship off to a good start. Without those guideposts, a new CEO will continue to behave consistently with what they have done previously. What has worked for them before may work against them now, and ongoing feedback is critical for successful adaptation. Creating a formal development plan based on the selection assessment results represents one best practice.</li>
 	<li><b> Discuss performance expectations: </b>It will be important for both the board and the CEO to voice their expectations early in the new relationship so everyone has a clear roadmap to work from. Those expectations can cover what the key performance metrics are and how the board-CEO relationship will ideally play out. Providing the new CEO with a clear set of behavioral guidelines and goals will help them assimilate more rapidly into a new culture.</li>
 	<li><b> Establish an ongoing communication cadence: </b>As previous <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/board-governance-dimensions-which-correlate-most-with-positive-organizational-outcomes/">research</a> from RHR International’s <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-founder/">Board &amp; CEO Services</a> practice indicates, the quality of the communication between the board and the CEO is highly correlated with organizational performance. Identifying the frequency and process for communications will be important. There will be formal presentations and informal conversations that take place, and laying the groundwork for the expected frequency and length of those interactions should help provide guidance for both parties. For example, setting the expectation for the CEO to send an email to the board to recap action steps from the last board meeting and establish the agenda for the next meeting will help ensure clear communication.</li>
 	<li><b> Start with questions, not with statements: </b>Ideally, the board will be an important source of advice for the new CEO. Unsolicited advice can lead to resistance, so it is advisable for the board to initially hold back on their opinions and first respond to the CEO’s requests for counsel. As the relationship becomes solidified over time, the board members can use their own judgment about what advice is likely to be valued by the CEO. In the best-case scenario, there will be an open and fluid give-and-take about individual and organizational performance by both parties. This should be guided by the fiduciary responsibility that both the board and the CEO own.</li>
 	<li><b> Invest the time needed to establish rapport: </b>Any new CEO recognizes that their relationship with the board is fundamental to their long-term success. They will need to invest the time needed to understand the personalities involved and what their communication needs and preferences are. At the same time, the new CEO can help solidify relationships by sharing their vision for the business and asking for input on strategy. Both formal board meetings and informal dinners will help facilitate that goal. Over time, the investment in relationship development a board and CEO make will generate a foundation that promotes trust and transparency.</li>
 	<li><b> Recognize that each board-CEO relationship is unique: </b>It is natural for the board to look at a new CEO in the context of the former CEO. If the relationship was positive, the board will try to replicate that dynamic with the new leader, but if it was lacking in some way, the board will look to correct that deficit with a fresh start. Given that each board-CEO relationship is unique, it is important to give the new relationship some time to develop naturally before jumping to conclusions. Establishing a mutually beneficial relationship early on will help build lasting partnerships later on.</li>
</ol>
In summary, gaining clarity about expectations and establishing positive working relationships early in a new CEO’s tenure will lead to long-term success. Board-CEO interactions can be fragile at first, but if the foundation is solid, the alliance will be able to withstand the turbulence that is part of every new journey. Investing the time and energy needed to get off to a good start will pay dividends in the future.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Want to do better at selecting talent than the National Football League selects players? Here is what we learned from the research and from a Major League Baseball president that will improve your batting average.

NFL leaders succumb to natural bias, favoring athletes who are tall, fast, and strong. "It's about a particular cultural fascination with the idea of potential," Malcolm Gladwell, Canadian author and journalist, explains. "NFL teams think that these ‘natural athletes’ have more room to improve than anybody else. But the evidence suggests that if anything, those who are slower or shorter, and who have had to compensate for those deficiencies with increased hard work, guile, and intelligence prove to be better performers.”

So what does this have to say about <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-assessment/">assessing talent</a> beyond the gridiron? For one thing, it suggests that credentials such as the prestige BA or MBA diploma might not be as accurate a predictor as the individual’s track record in persevering and overcoming barriers and attitude toward continual learning and coaching.

Not long ago, in a conversation with the president of an MLB club, he spoke of the exhaustive process by which they initially assess talent. First, the player-development team meets to identify ideal key performance dimensions using Moneyball analytics such as on-base percentage for hitters, speed to the ball for outfielders, and velocity, movement, and on-base percentage for pitchers. Then scouts observe the play of teen athletes on high school or junior college diamonds to measure their athletic abilities and come back with hard data. What may surprise you is that while the scouts are on site, they also interview family members in the bleachers and observe a number of the obvious and many more subtle behaviors of the parents and siblings to get a sense for the kind of <i>adult</i> this athlete might become. At this stage, they are looking at the whole person, assessing character and role models—not just athletic performance. They combine these data sets with their own Moneyball analytics to decide which players to draft and how much to offer them.

When you are hiring, first get firm alignment regarding the position specifications among all key stakeholders. In a typical internal assessment interview you probably don’t have an eye to family background and core internal motivations. This is where a multifaceted external assessment can provide insight into the individual’s intellectual, emotional, and motivational makeup through skilled interviewing. A capable assessor teases out the factors that predict a candidate’s approach to self-development and ability to deal effectively with the inevitable setbacks that accompany managerial roles, both of which are robust predictors of future performance.

How do you get the complementary, Moneyball-type analytical hard data? Employ an in-depth personality inventory and tests that provide an objective read on raw capabilities and problem-solving performance under pressure. Combined, these two sources of data enable you to improve your batting average and make hiring decisions with the same kind of precision as best-in-class Major League Baseball teams.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We believe diversity and inclusion should be a journey of the heart but have been overly fought with the power of the mind instead. What does that mean? Generally, organizations follow a distinct and predictable path. The first stage focuses on bringing the conversation to the table, creating space for discussion, and perhaps kicking off initiatives and investing resources. As organizations continue to move through their transformational journey, the focus shifts to putting hard business metrics in place to legitimize the efforts and create a higher degree of accountability, and to increase the focus on development, acquisition, and retention. The gold standard on this journey (based on best practices from leading organizations) includes creating strategic objectives, launching programs that cut across all of HR and Talent, driving metrics that impact compensation and deliver value to the business, and ensuring consistent and clear communication and advocacy from the executive team.

The research and programs in this space are more robust and more focused than they have ever been. So why are best-in-class organizations still struggling with the same, or at least similar, challenges such as retention, attraction, and pipeline development of the female and diverse talent in the organization despite effort and investments over time? More importantly, why are employees, specifically racially, ethnically, and culturally diverse employees, still feeling excluded and shut out of key opportunities? Why are women still trying to find equity and a space for the capabilities they bring to the table? These are big questions that often have well-intentioned, well-meaning, and results-oriented business leaders scratching their heads.

We believe the answer lies not in the <b><i>what</i></b> but in the <b><i>how</i></b>. Organizations are doing many things “right,” and those starting on their journey now have access to incredible best practices that will meaningfully accelerate the change journey. However, what is often missing is a true sense of connection and purpose to D&amp;I from the C-suite—who are ultimately responsible for creating a culture that fosters a deep sense of belonging1. We define belonging as having the ability to be seen, to participate in difficult conversations, and to have a feeling of trust in the system that will support individual growth. How might we cultivate this? We believe it takes curiosity, courage, and compassion.
<h2>Curiosity</h2>
We must be human in our ability to understand the difference. This means that we must enter our interactions with others with a deep sense of <b><i>curiosity</i></b>. Who are they? How did they become the individual they are today? What has shaped them as leaders and contributors to the work that they aspire to and are doing? This may not be radical, but it requires the ability to really connect, take the time and effort to engage, and seek to understand. Purposefully creating an emotional connection to the experiences others have had and fast-tracking trust is a critical requirement for true advocacy and followership. The added side benefit is it begins to dismantle our mental biases.
<h2>Courage</h2>
Curiosity falls short without <b><i>courage</i></b>. Engaging with others who are different than us in a meaningful way is scary. Asking questions and being willing to say the wrong thing or say things in the wrong way feels off-limits. This means being willing to have conversations about race, culture, gender, and all the things that make people unique and different. We need the courage to push us to be transparent about what we don’t know, to admit our mistakes, and to ask for forgiveness for our imperfections when we do not get it right. This is exactly where intention, effort, and interest come together to allow us to learn, grow, and reach out and build deeper understanding and relationships.
<h2>Compassion</h2>
Neither curiosity nor courage work without <b><i>compassion</i></b>. Empathy and the positive intention to place yourself in the shoes of others are critical to keeping difficult conversations safe for everyone. We must be willing to share our own stories, to find the places in which we have felt excluded, and most importantly, to share how our own journeys have shaped how we feel about inclusion and belonging. Employees must see leaders as humans who are willing to be open and curious and who have a genuine interest in the lives of those around them.

Following best practices and setting, metrics help organizations deliver on the right set of tactics and programs, create awareness and accountability, and create space for conversations to occur. However, it is the nature of these dialogues and the everyday connections we make that will create the cultural shifts businesses are striving for and the environments that will bring the best thinking, innovation, and talent forward.

This work is based on a year-long research project by RHR International that included interviews with CEOs, CHROs, Diversity and Talent officers, and boards.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,”—that is all</i>

<i>Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know. </i>

This line ends the poem “Ode on a Grecian Urn” by John Keats. The poem is essentially an exploration to discern the true meaning of an object (the urn) that is under the poet’s study. It is full of paradox and different perspectives and interpretations of the various depictions on the urn and even the shape of the urn itself. In the poem, Keats poses many questions to us about the urn and, at the end, tries to assure us of its own apparent wisdom, as captured in those famous final lines. As presented by the poem, it would be safe to conclude the urn does not have one overriding, singular meaning. Over the years, readers and critics have made many different interpretations of the questions and exclamations the poem contains.

So, what does all this have to do with leadership and the search for truth? And why does this matter?
<h3>Leaders are expected to know, to have an opinion, and to be able to express a clear point of view.</h3>
Their followers may demand and find comfort in having some level of certainty and predictability, and they may not only look to but also want to trust their leaders to provide this. And yet the complexity, ambiguity, and dynamism of today’s business environment make definitive positions harder and perhaps inherently riskier to take. How leaders form their opinions and make decisions are hugely shaped by how they approach gathering information. How they are seen to go about the business of becoming well-informed has a material impact on their credibility and, consequently, the level of trust their followers are willing to place in them. How they express their point of view and their willingness to say when they don’t know, how they permit themselves to be vulnerable and humble, and if they admit when they don’t have an answer or can’t forecast or predict the future can all have a material impact on how they are trusted.
<h3>Challenges today are complex.</h3>
This is not a new phenomenon; however, most of the challenges we face today are hugely complex. Our attempts to address them, though, can often start with overly narrow definitions of the problem that are limited by subjective opinion and judiciously selected facts. The danger then is that we risk failing to recognize material factors that can derail our well-intended decisions, interventions, and solutions and render them ineffective. In Alan Watkins and Ken Wilber’s book, Wicked &amp; Wise, the authors build on the research of Horst WJ Rittel and Melvin M. Webber and conclude that in fact, most seemingly intractable—or as they term them, wicked—problems are multidimensional and have multiple stakeholders, causes, interdependent systems, and solutions, and, to cap all that, each of these elements are themselves constantly evolving. All of this speaks to a need for leaders to take a wider and deeper approach to information gathering and encourage their colleagues to do the same, <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">in order to be better informed about the challenges they are facing</a> and to be better placed to evaluate the likely impact—both the positive, intended outcomes and potential unintended consequences of the interventions they select.
<h3>Misinformation is rife in society.</h3>
Moreover, not only are the problems leaders face more complex but also, misinformation is rife in today’s society. We may believe that our sources of information are diverse, trustworthy, and impartial. But are they?

Despite our best endeavors to be discerning, unless we make a conscious effort, our sources of information in this digital age are more likely to be determined by how our profile is understood by social media algorithms and by with whom we choose to socialize our thinking. If we are unaware of this, we can unwittingly be feeding ourselves a highly partial rather than impartial view of the world. We have seen how different social groups can come to see the world in such different and often polarized ways. Each group being fed and consuming information that confirms their narrow view can express complete opposition to other viewpoints in more extreme cases and, at their worst, denies their legitimacy. These social and social media bubbles create isolated tribes whose narratives are restricted and who act like an echo chamber where only like-minded expressions of opinion are accommodated. It is clear that a more holistic view can only be gained by elevating our thinking and making room to accommodate a wider range of perspectives. However, this still calls for us to question how we trust the information we depend on and to consider how, as leaders, we persuade others then to trust in our judgment when we ask them to.
<h3>Trust in leaders is declining, but there is an opportunity for business leaders to have a greater positive impact on society.</h3>
The current data on trust levels does not make great reading. Trust in leaders across all sectors in society has been steadily declining. The Edelman 2021 Trust Barometer shows a widespread fall in levels of trust in governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), media, and businesses. It is not surprising then, given this worrying level of distrust in government, that we have seen political leaders’ proclamations being subjected to fact-checking. Ironically, this has largely been conducted by media in whom we also have declining levels of trust.

Edelman suggests that at this time, there is an opportunity for leaders in business to take the lead on a wide range of issues and have a greater and more positive impact in shaping our society, not only for the benefit of the organizations they lead but also for society as a whole. Their findings indicated that business is trusted more than government and trust in employers is stable or rising in 18 out of 27 countries. Worryingly though, among the nine countries where trust is declining are the U.S., Japan, and the UK.
<h3>How Should Leaders Approach Information Gathering?</h3>
Being trusted requires transparency and diligence when sharing information, honesty when expressing a point of view, and a willingness to listen to others. So how do we reduce the risk of being misinformed as leaders?
<ol>
 	<li>
<h4>Recognize that all truths or versions thereof are partial.</h4>
</li>
</ol>
First, we need to reflect on the nature of truth, in a similar vein to Keats. We need to develop a richer understanding of the partial nature of what we consider to be true. All our perspectives are distorted to an extent by our own approach to meaning making. Self-reflection is required to examine the nature of our own perspectives and how they are influenced and informed. As we reflect, we may be surprised to find hidden biases that are shaping our worldview and predetermining which information sources we place and, in some cases, misplace our trust.
<ol start="2">
 	<li>
<h4>Accept that multiple and seemingly incompatible truths can and do exist.</h4>
</li>
</ol>
Second, recognize that multiple competing and seemingly incompatible truths may coexist. Discounting facts that don’t align with our personal worldview is fraught with danger. Rather than seeing conflicting or contrary views as sources of tension, we should view them as a rich source of potential learning and creativity. Each perspective is in and of itself partial, and in each perspective, there probably is some small but potentially important nugget of truth. Gathering a wide range of perspectives gives us a better chance of identifying not only the larger, most significant nuggets but also the smaller yet important ones to factor into our thinking.
<ol start="3">
 	<li>
<h4>Recognize that what holds true for now may not tomorrow.</h4>
</li>
</ol>
Third, acknowledge the temporal nature of truth. What we assume to be true today may over time turn out to be less true than we first thought. We need to stay constantly curious and intentionally leverage the power of critical thinking as a necessary skill set to test assumptions to see if they still hold true as situations change and evolve.
<ol start="4">
 	<li>
<h4>Be discerning, yes, but also build an eclectic information diet; the more diverse, the better.</h4>
</li>
</ol>
Finally, consider expanding the range of information sources you explore. Intentionally consider the <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">diversity of your network</a>. Many organizations trust and over index on making use of internally generated data and are highly selective about making use of external information providers. There are two potential traps here that leader’s risk unintentionally falling into. The first is where we overly narrow our perspective and the second is where we only seek information that supports our preferred narrative and discount that which contradicts it. To avoid this, leaders need to seek a wide variety of independent outsider viewpoints. Consider perspectives generated from as many other vantage points as possible, e.g., competitors, other industries, and industry analysts. Make sure your selection is truly diverse and does not inherently amplify unconscious bias. Leaders need to consider information sources as if part of a diet; to be of nutritional value, it needs to be diverse.

Taking a more sophisticated and nuanced approach to information gathering will help improve the effectiveness of leaders’ decision-making. After all, we might be able to agree, on principle, that the better-informed leaders are, the better position they will be in to make decisions.

Next in this blog series, we will look at how decisions are made and the steps leaders can take to improve decision quality in their teams and the wider organizations they lead.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The world watched on January 20 as President Joe Biden took office, to see what signals he would send about the trajectory of his presidency. For those hoping he would take immediate and effective action on climate change, we were not disappointed. On day one, he rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, revoked a permit for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, and signed a series of executive orders to embed renewable energy goals and other climate initiatives throughout his administration.

At RHR, we believe leadership is a noble endeavor. In this decade, there may be no more noble endeavor for the president of the United States than setting the country and the world on a path to a more sustainable future. The POTUS is already off to a good start, but there are many leadership challenges to come, so we would like to offer Joe a little advice.
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Prioritize and stay focused.  </b>Great leaders provide unambiguous direction about the top priorities, staying focused on the very few issues that matter most. Early messaging out of the Biden administration makes it clear that combating climate change is a signature issue for him. Having a communication strategy that keeps climate change above the fold, even as more provocative news headlines threaten to push the issue further from the public forum, will help maintain legislative focus on the issue.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Utilize his sources of power.  </b>Biden will be confronted with both active and passive resistance to his plans for a future free of man-made carbon. In response to these forces, he will need to understand where he has leverage and where his sources of power reside. Biden has at his disposal more forms of influence than did his predecessor, because he is less inclined to think only in terms of zero-sum games and punitive power. A leader capable of collaborating and expanding the size of the pie can use both carrot and stick. He’ll need both to be fully credible on the foreign and domestic battlegrounds of the climate crisis.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Link sustainability to superordinate goals. </b> Lining up his climate agenda with overarching objectives that attract proponents from both sides of the aisle, such as national security and job creation, would be a smart move for Biden. Shifting the conversation away from a polarizing discussion about antecedents and consequences and toward responsive action steps that everyone can get behind would help maintain early momentum. In addition, connecting Biden’s climate agenda to national unity, a major topic of his campaign, will strengthen his position. Biden clearly believes that unity itself is a superordinate goal. Paradoxically, calls for unity might not have the power to unify. But good green jobs that employ people across the political spectrum, in both red and blue states, could have that effect.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Empower the right team of diverse and expert thinkers.</b>  It won’t be Biden’s own ideas that turn the tide on climate change, it will be all the best ideas available. We’re well past the point of knowing for certain that to solve the most complex problems you need a diverse set of problem solvers. This is not the moment for cronyism or inexpert leadership from the key climate-related agencies or favors granted for political chips. We need the best in the field—the true science and policy experts—and we need them to be representative of a diversity of perspectives.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Show progress.  </b>In unpredictable times, and with so many complex and intractable problems, <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/crisis-and-disruption-a-framework-for-leadership/">good leadership is managing crisis-to-crisis</a> while simultaneously assuring people that you care, and that important work is being done to resolve issues. This could be the nature of Biden’s presidency. In such conditions, the imperative is to demonstrate progress on key issues. A quick, incontrovertible win goes a long way toward establishing credibility for a new leader. Interestingly, it would not need to be a quick win on climate. A quick win on any important issue, like COVID-19, for example, would continue to position Biden as a strong leader.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Leverage data.</b>  There may be no better place to access and use facts and information than from the most powerful seat in the White House. The United States has an extraordinary history of collecting scientific information across a broad spectrum of measures, including the weather, air quality, and economic and financial metrics. Leveraged properly, this information can be used to show progress and focus on outcomes that use facts and data.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Take care of himself.  </b>It shouldn’t go unnoticed that the oldest POTUS in the history of the country is also faced with some of the most difficult challenges posed in the history of the country. At the age of 78, Biden has done well to position himself as healthy and capable—sometimes doing a short jog to the podium during press events, an action we don’t recall other presidents doing. The stark differences in the before and after images of our living presidents are powerful representations of the energetic toll taken by serving in the highest office. We know that resilience is improved through personal discipline and diligence within the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual domains.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Choose his legacy.  </b>A POTUS always leaves a legacy—for better or worse. The question for Joe will be the nature of this legacy. Did he create unity? Did he repair rifts in the democratic process? Did he heal the pain of the losses during the pandemic? Did he set us on a new course for a sustainable future? It’s not too soon for the president to imagine how history will judge him and to step into his legacy.</li>
</ol>
The choices that he makes about using his position, his will, and his power can determine the answers to these questions. We wish him well, and if Joe has any questions, we’re happy to chat, because at RHR, <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-teams/">we shape leaders</a>, and leaders shape the world.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s your first day of work as a newly appointed executive, and the anticipation is running high. As more and more people join the Zoom call on your screen, you smile and introduce yourself. Everything seems to be running smoothly, but you can’t help but ask yourself: “How can I ensure I put my best foot forward? How will I gain the respect of my new peers in this virtual environment? How will I make the right impact on this organization?” Those questions are valid—the success of a new executive’s career, and perhaps the entire organization, rests heavily on how well they integrate into their new role. Facilitating a successful integration earlier rather than later lays the groundwork for executives to forge alliances and drive the business strategy forward in the long term. And although successful integration has always posed a challenge to newly appointed executives, that challenge is only amplified when coupled with onboarding during a global pandemic.

Pandemic aside, <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Executive-Integration-Stumbling-to-the-Top.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies suggest that up to 25% of executives</a> promoted or transferred within the same organization will fail. The bulk of failed integrations are the result of an inability to build relationships. Other challenges known to derail new leaders are cultural misalignments, lack of clarity surrounding the role and expectations, failure to secure an early win, and inability to get up to speed on how the organization works. Ultimately, these challenges pose an even greater threat for today’s newly appointed executives, who run the risk of a failed integration without in-person support and collaboration.

Given these known challenges, RHR has identified<b> five key success factors </b>for executives transitioning to new roles:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Role clarity: </b>the comprehensive understanding of the role, mandate, and expected deliverables.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Building relationships: </b>forming, defining, and strengthening connections to individuals in the organization to build credibility and candor.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Learning and navigating culture: </b>understanding and adapting to the organization’s values, beliefs, behaviors, and attitudes.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Early wins: </b>securing an accomplishment up front to establish credibility in a new role.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Advanced learning: </b>learning the business, the organization, and the people when stepping into a new role, as well as new skills required to carry out the role successfully.</li>
</ul>
Despite the ongoing pandemic, these success factors have, in fact, remained quite the same. What has changed are the methods leaders must employ to achieve those success factors, given that the global business landscape and ways of working have fundamentally shifted. Indeed, integration during COVID-19 has added <b>a new layer of challenge to three of these five success factors</b> in particular.
<ol>
 	<li>
<h3>Building Relationships</h3>
</li>
</ol>
Although water-cooler banter and corporate lunches may be a thing of the past for now, building relationships in an organization remains vital to the success of transitioning leaders.

Thankfully, technologies like Zoom have afforded us the luxury of (virtually) connecting with colleagues face-to-face. And considering that it enables us to connect with more people than we could in our own offices, Zoom opens new doors for heightened communication.

Newly appointed leaders should make a point to be intentional about forming personal connections in remote meetings. This is especially true early on in the onboarding phase. Although it’s common to receive a list of company policies and procedures in the first few days of the job, onboarding executives are seldom provided insight into key strategies for forging relationships and navigating the culture in an organization. It is best practice for new executives to be proactive and intentional about this aspect of integration. Generally, it is sound advice for new leaders to overcommunicate and stay visible. Take opportunities to check in with individuals and small groups to avoid an information vacuum. Deliberately create small groups of five to six people to make space to hear varying perspectives and fresh ideas from colleagues.

Moreover, meet with your boss to create stakeholder maps. Leverage these maps to be strategic, targeted, and intentional about developing relationships. Identifying someone from that stakeholder map to act as a mentor to engage with one-on-one can open up further opportunities for deepening relationships. Whether you partake in weekly check-ins, virtual coffee meetups, or other activities, be intentional about regularly staying in touch to foster a sense of camaraderie, candor, and connection.

Other insights for building relationships virtually include:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Set up regular one-on-ones with key stakeholders. Keep the meetings even if it feels like there is nothing to discuss.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Set recurring meetings with direct reports. Defining a regular cadence will ensure everyone knows to expect touchpoints. You may also consider scheduling open office hours or a virtual happy hour in which anyone is welcome to pop in for questions and conversation. In a virtual environment, you miss out on opportunistic people coming into your office to say hello.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Take advantage of the new opportunities that a virtual working environment lends you. For example, a newly appointed executive in New York can meet with a stakeholder in Mumbai quickly and effectively, without ever needing to board a plane.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Show vulnerability. Ask for help when you need it.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Set the groundwork for a <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-teams/">senior team effectiveness</a> engagement (e.g., work on team purpose). Demonstrate that, yes, this can be done in a virtual environment.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Have a fun Zoom call with your team, perhaps with a puzzle, game, or virtual happy hour.</li>
</ul>
It should also be noted that although Zoom has become the standard for organizational communications, there is another tool at your disposal: <b>the telephone. </b>“Call people just to say hello; no business agenda needed,” says Jeff Kirschner, partner and client manager in RHR’s New York office. In the flurry of back-to-back Zoom meetings and virtual happy hours, it’s easy to forget that a simple phone call can serve as a warm reminder of the value of a one-on-one connection.

New leaders will also benefit from asking for explicit role clarity and relationship expectations from their managers early on. Be proactive in asking to be included in key meetings and circulation lists. Granted, these action items are what would typically occur in the pre-COVID era—but in a virtual environment with no in-person contact, they’re much more liable to slip through the cracks.
<ol start="2">
 	<li>
<h3>Learning and Navigating Culture</h3>
</li>
</ol>
Understanding and adapting to the culture of an organization is crucial to the success of new leaders. Implicit rules and beliefs held by people in the organization can be subtle and are frequently communicated nonverbally, often through signs, symbols, and body language in the environment that can only be experienced while physically present. This means that learning the culture is even more challenging in virtual meetings, but by no means is it impossible.

Do your homework before stepping into the new role. (Of course, this goes without saying, pandemic or not). Read up on the organization’s history, review employee bios, and scan organizational charts. Check Glassdoor to discover what kinds of things other people say about the organization and be prepared to ask explicit questions about culture as you are meeting with people. Discuss the company’s values and behaviors. Cast a wide net when asking questions; reach out to the board, your predecessor, peers, consultants, investors, etc. Identify key stakeholders and check in with them frequently.

New leaders can also benefit from the following takeaways:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Early on, ask to join meetings even if they’re not directly relevant to the role. Make yourself available and interested in your new role and even other ad hoc events you may be invited to. This is easier to do with tools like Zoom, which allow new leaders to seamlessly access meetings without disruption.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Meet with your boss to discuss whom you need to meet across the organization. Ask your boss to broker the invitation.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Find a mentor or someone who just integrated to discuss specific aspects of the culture.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Use tools like FaceTime to do "virtual tours" of facilities you can't visit.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Conduct team exercises around defining the culture, both espoused and actual. For example,  create a Stormboard to discuss the behaviors your organization would like to promote or extinguish, identify objectives to fulfill, and explore the ways in which the culture both advances and hinders company growth. Identify any patterns in your colleagues’ goals and objectives regarding company culture.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Conduct listening tours and proactively reach out to people outside of your function. Ask questions such as: “What does success look like here? What helps people move up the ranks? What are things to absolutely avoid?”</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Demonstrate respect for what has become before. Vocalize respect for what people have done.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Ask questions regarding rules or etiquette for virtual meetings. Does the company require formal dress, or is casual attire acceptable? What’s the stance on using a Zoom background? When do people typically switch their video on and off? It is vital to pay extra attention to these subtle cultural factors in a virtual environment.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">As a general rule, new executives should ask for feedback from their managers early and often.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
 	<li>
<h3>Early Wins</h3>
</li>
</ol>
Securing an easy win up front is critical for new hires to establish credibility in an organization. It is a key opportunity for executives to demonstrate their capabilities and prove they are worthy of the job. This doesn’t mean new hires are expected to move mountains on their first day—but it does mean they should leverage the tools at their disposal to connect with colleagues and drive the company’s mission forward in the early days of their tenure.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Trust the new team to highlight specific problems—focus on problems that others perceive.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Look for low-hanging fruit to gather a quick win, perhaps by leveraging a previous experience. Bring a best practice from your old job.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Operate with a sense of urgency. Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good and don't wait until you have a perfect plan to communicate.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Build out explicit goals and plans for early wins with your manager and peer teams.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Celebrate successes with your team early and often.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Hold individual meetings with direct reports to discuss their career goals and objectives to generate feedback early on.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Driving a Successful Virtual Integration</h3>
Successful leadership transitions are challenging, and navigating those challenges during COVID-19 requires adaptability, tenacity, and empathy. In emphasizing these three key success factors, leaders will be better prepared to navigate the uncharted waters of integration during a global pandemic—and to serve their organizations with lasting, meaningful impact.

Newly appointed executives shouldn’t have to navigate a virtual integration process on their own. With more than 75 years of experience in executive coaching, executive integration, and C-suite succession, RHR is here to help. Our <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">executive services and succession model</a> have played a critical role in helping executives gain a foothold in their new roles and establish candor, trust, and alliances with peers while driving mission-critical strategy forward.

“Understanding your strengths, weaknesses, and blind spots is even more critical while you’re onboarding into a new role in a virtual environment,” a financial services senior executive said recently. “Working with a coach can help ensure that you stay laser focused on addressing those blind spots while at the same time lifting your overall leadership game to a new level.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week’s events in Washington, D.C., were sad, disgraceful, and will leave a permanent scar on what we consider to be one of the most important fundamental concepts in the United States—democracy. When leadership intentionally misleads people, working only in self-interest, bad things happen. We saw the results of a deterioration of trust, fueled division, a targeted misinformation strategy, and an attempt to disrupt and terrorize a process to certify our next president, Joe Biden, and next vice president, Kamala Harris. This is unacceptable behavior, and it should be condemned at the highest level of our government and private organizations.

Our mission as an organization continues to be so important. We all know that strong leadership is the centerpiece for healthy and active change. And since we are in the leadership business, there is so much work to do to help facilitate this monumental shift. Our daily work with leadership at the top of organizations across the globe continues to be a massive lever in helping restore trust and reduce the deep divisions we currently see in the world, our communities, and our organizations. As leaders, we must continue to foster an environment of compassion, openness, and authenticity, and we must redefine success.

We need to move away from the idea that success will happen overnight with an allocation of resources, the hiring of one or two critical roles, or with the various list of tactical activities without a clear vision. Success starts with reflecting on the business and culture we want and by connecting to our own impact and influence on that environment. The divisions and inequity we see around us happens because of our inability to understand how our power and advantages have allowed us to create cultures and standards for our organizations that are narrow and exclusive. We must hold ourselves to the highest bar and model inclusive leadership that enables us to build organizations where we can leverage the full capacity and potential of all of our employees.

An inclusive leader, one who can continue to <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">maintain diversity and inclusion</a> as a cornerstone of the enterprise, is an agent of transformation who makes a meaningful and lasting difference.

Inclusive leaders share four fundamental characteristics:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>They are agile learners.</b> Inclusive leaders continuously seek connection and understanding across all the cultures and differences in their enterprises. Further, they proactively apply learnings to their leadership approach so that inclusiveness and belonging continues to improve.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>They are culturally fluent. </b>Inclusive leaders step out and ask questions, even if they are experiencing discomfort, and demonstrate their willingness to be taught.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>They are humble. </b>Inclusive leaders use their power intentionally and with thought. While seeking authentic connection and engagement, they understand the potential impact they make and manage their power to good effect.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>They are courageous.</b> Inclusive leaders understand that transformation means seeking out and dismantling system inequities and bias. They have the courage to do whatever is needed to accomplish this.</li>
</ul>
I am very hopeful that leadership in our organizations, in our governments, and around the world will get this right. I am optimistic that I will get this right by being reflective, willing to learn, courageous, and by modeling humility. Courage sometimes looks like the simple willingness to be uncomfortable or share a story about ourselves. And sometimes courage means standing up for something bigger than ourselves and taking a point of view that makes us more visible than we are comfortable with. We must be willing to lead each other through a pandemic, social divisions, and the biggest disruption to democracy we have seen in our lifetime.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[COVID-19 has forced businesses to pause and ask what their customers need in this new environment and how to best deliver. New strategies beg for a different kind of talent and a redefining of roles and thus the need to breathe fresh air into the talent development frame and conversation. Leaders now need to make good on the promise of developing people for career and life success versus success in the siloed role they were hired for.
<h3>Out of Sight, Out of Mind?</h3>
Despite the business imperative for creating real-time development plans and pathways, employees are feeling neglected, and managers are realizing they've dropped the ball on talent development. Why is this happening? Gone are the days of managers gathering feedback on performance and impact at the coffee pot or by dropping by a colleague’s office.  These days, talent development conversations have to be done with more intentionality than ever before. Carving out time for meaningful talent-development conversations requires conscious effort and time; time that is becoming less and less available given the way people’s workdays are hijacked with Zoom calls. Less real-time interaction combined with less peer feedback leads to less-meaningful mentorship.
<h3>Leveraging the Virtual Environment for Talent Development</h3>
While the current situation may feel like it’s making purposeful talent development evermore challenging, a virtual office can actually be a boon to talent development in these ways:
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1">The virtual workplace may actually be a better environment for one-on-one conversations away from the distractions of the office or being overheard.  In many ways, it’s more focused and potentially more intense. Video conferencing into our homes provides a window into the personal side of life that hasn’t been visible before. The artifice of professionalism and being on one’s best behavior—putting on one’s game face—has been stripped away to some degree.  It’s a great equalizer, leveling the playing field and opening up the possibilities for greater self-revelation, the sharing of concerns, and mutual empathy.  But this requires managers to carve out that time.   In a virtual environment, you either have intentionality around developing your people or not.  The lack of intentionality is very obvious without the casual interactions of the old workplace.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">“Apprenticeship” can be accomplished much easier in a virtual environment where the team member seeking growth can now easily accompany the leader on any engagement, and they can work together seamlessly using virtual tools to jump across continents. The more exposure they get to all forms of doing business, the better their business toolbox and the stronger they are to carry it.  It is certainly easier to get “range” virtually.  (See Range by David Epstein.) Look for opportunities to include team members in virtual meetings that they normally would not be exposed to.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Virtual working provides greater opportunities for visibility since you can move quickly from meeting to meeting without travel time, yielding more opportunities for exposure and one-on-one feedback from peers. Encourage team members to sign up for internal task forces or work groups where volunteers are needed. It’s easier to create cross-functional touch points, bringing a greater diversity of people and ideas into the conversation to speed innovation and the dissemination of new ideas and processes that enable talent to flourish.  (<a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/how-covid-19-may-actually-increase-diversity-and-inclusion-for-many-companies/">See Jimmy Davis’s and Lisa Carey’s 7/23 blog How COVID-19 May Actually Increase Diversity and Inclusion for Many Companies.</a>) Actively facilitate creative problem-solving by tapping into diverse voices and perspectives from near and far.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Companies can accelerate and enrich the onboarding process for new hires using video technology.  Engage HR and IT in creating a virtual tour of the organization and all the relevant stakeholders for each job sector that is hiring.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Because we can now literally see into each other’s lives, it opens the door to talk about life goals to enrich the development conversation, extending it beyond current role and career ambitions. Seize the opportunity to show an interest in employees lives beyond the office door, and use that newfound knowledge to create more meaningful, truly personalized development plans.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Battlefield promotions:  In a crisis such as COVID-19 there is no playbook.  A vacuum is created and leaders emerge, stepping up and bringing latent strengths to light.  Often, these aren’t the same folks who were carrying the flag before the crisis.  So take note of who stepped up—they may just be your future leaders.</li>
</ol>
In a virtual environment, we can’t approach <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">talent development</a> using old habits. If properly leveraged, a virtual environment presents distinct new opportunities and advantages. Leaders can engage employees in their homes and grow the leaders who will help your company find its way through 2021 and beyond.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Boards of directors and management teams have been facing unprecedented challenges this year. First, they are navigating the global pandemic and economic crisis and its aftermath. COVID-19 has forced companies to quickly adapt and alter the way they go to market and serve their customers. Supply chains have been disrupted, customer interfaces have shifted, and consumer preferences and habits have changed as well. Second, directors and management teams are also coming to terms with the reality of the systemic and unending racism and unnecessary police violence against people of color within the U.S. and the actions they are going to take. More than ever before, directors will need to serve as catalysts and role models for driving toward greater diversity, inclusion, and belonging within their boards, the companies they serve, and the broader communities of which they are a part.

Every organization has been wrestling with how the health and economic crises have impacted their company, including the way that the board and management team have navigated the ensuing threats and opportunities. A recent <a href="https://boardmember.com/the-new-normal-in-governance-a-paradigm-shift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Corporate Board Member </i>article</a>, “The New Normal In Governance: A Paradigm Shift?,” highlighted the ways some boards have responded to these challenges. One recommendation the directors who were interviewed offered was to conduct an after-action review of the board and management team’s responses to the COVID-19 crisis. Capturing the collective views of board members regarding what went well, what did not, <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-assessment/">insights about the board</a>, the company, and the senior team and the implications for moving forward allows the board to ensure that lessons learned the hard way do not have to be repeated. And this process can also increase the ability of the company to build upon the opportunities and strengths that emerged. One approach to doing this is to incorporate the review into the board’s annual evaluation process. Here are some suggestions about how to do that.
<h3>What to Include in the Board Evaluation</h3>
A standard board evaluation, to be thorough, should include inquiry about each dimension of governance that contributes to effective discharge of a board’s oversight responsibility. These dimensions include the board’s purpose and strategy, composition and structure, risk management and safeguards, board culture, board and CEO partnership, and board renewal. More information on these dimensions is available in this RHR blog on board evaluation: (<a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/evaluating-your-board-seven-areas-to-assess/">https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/evaluating-your-board-seven-areas-assess</a>).

However, with the unique circumstances presented by both the COVID-19 pandemic and the social unrest stemming from ongoing and systemic racial inequities, this year’s evaluation of these dimensions should be conducted through a lens focused on how effectively the board functioned in meeting the challenges posed by the pandemic and the implications moving forward regarding addressing systemic inequities and promoting diversity and inclusion. Here are a few areas for the board to examine:
<h3>The Board’s Value Add</h3>
Given the rapidly emerging challenges and opportunities companies have navigated over this year, great questions for directors to ask themselves are:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">What value did the company need our board to contribute, and, how well did we deliver that value?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">In addition to good governance, what did we bring to the organization that significantly helped?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What could we have done differently that would have brought even greater, more relevant, or timelier impact?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reality Check</h3>
Many directors found that the pandemic forced an ongoing reality check regarding how robust and relevant fundamental aspects of the business remained. While many companies are finding ways to weather the storm or even thrive, capturing the learnings and implications of these changes will be important.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">What did the pandemic teach us about our company’s strategy, business model, capital structure, and supply-chain dependencies?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What are the implications for us moving forward?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Given what we know about our company, the business environment, and the market trends, what do we need to accelerate or revise in terms of major decisions or actions we had been considering?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">How do we ensure ongoing alignment within the board and with the senior team as we continue to engage in scenario planning?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risk Management and Emergencies</h3>
While a small but significant number of companies had anticipated some of the potential risks and had plans in place to cover situations similar to the pandemic, others were caught flatfooted. Sometimes this level of discipline was driven by the company’s chief risk officer or other senior executives, while sometimes this preparation was catalyzed by the board. Key questions to ask include:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">How well did the company respond to the crisis?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What did it fail to anticipate?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">How quickly did it adapt?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What, if any, adjustments need to be made in our company’s risk assessment process and emergency preparedness?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Do we know where emerging potential risks are moving forward, and have we taken the necessary steps to mitigate them?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Finally, do we have a well-defined emergency succession plan in place, not just a name in an envelope? This may be an obvious question given the pandemic, but unfortunately the answer is not always “yes.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology</h3>
Ironically, many companies found themselves moving almost overnight on actions involving technology, working remotely, or reaching their customers virtually that they had previously deliberated for months, if not years. Those that were already leveraging technology to a high degree as part of their business model and had already launched significant investments in this area and/or already had established processes for working virtually faced considerably less disruption. Even those who found this adjustment to be a heavy lift are realizing that a virtual model may remain viable, at least in part, for their company moving forward. Many are choosing to keep some form of this virtual approach until a vaccine is found.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Given this, another area to probe among directors is, are our technology capabilities, IT infrastructure, and cybersecurity protections adequate for what we will need in the future?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Talent</h3>
The pandemic offered an unexpected in vivo test of how key leaders in companies respond in a crisis, how well they navigate through ambiguity to make timely and sound decisions, and about their ability to engage, focus, and rally others. Directors have found, to their surprise, that there was often a broader range of leadership effectiveness demonstrated by those in senior roles and in the talent pipeline than they had anticipated. Some executives demonstrated exceptional abilities to lead while others became stymied. Key questions for directors to ask themselves are:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">What have we learned about the <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">strengths and development needs</a> of mission-critical talent?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What changes need to be made to our approach in recruiting, retaining, and evaluating talent?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Given that many boards and CEOs are coming to the same realization about their talent pipelines, what steps do we need to take to keep those who really stood out during these times to ensure that they are not poached to fill gaps in other organizations?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Finally, how well do we understand the company’s culture regarding creating a common and compelling purpose, embracing diversity, and creating a sense of belonging?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Board Composition</h3>
The rapid pace of decision-making placed a higher expectation on board members to remain current, have a sound understanding of the business and its financial aspects, and be able to quickly home in on what is important. Companies also looked to their directors to help leverage their networks to understand what other companies were seeing, how they were responding, and to help quickly connect senior leaders to needed expertise or resources. While boards have always expected their directors to be prepared for meetings and ready to contribute, the pace of events took this need to an even higher level.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Given this experience, what have we learned about the strengths and development implications for our board’s composition?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What do we need to solve for in terms of the composition of the board (e.g., requisite expertise and acumen relevant to our business, strength of the directors’ networks to access resources on behalf of the company, and the diversity of the board)?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What targeted education or development do we need to bring to current board members?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Board Culture</h3>
The rapid switch to working virtually during this pandemic impacted boards as well as their companies. In addition to the logistics involved in making this change, board members were forced to engage with one another in high-stakes circumstances without all of the interpersonal cues that were available during in-person meetings. Board leaders noted the new challenge of detecting the nuances and managing the interpersonal dynamics in a virtual environment, all while making rapid and significant decisions. Key questions in this evaluation should include:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">What are the lessons we learned and can apply in the future about our board’s culture and how we communicated and made decisions in a virtual operating mode?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What should we build upon, and what do we need to change?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Diversity and Inclusion</h3>
The Black Lives Matter movement has highlighted the board’s responsibility for ensuring their organizations are recruiting and growing leaders, developing strategies, and evolving cultures that <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">promote diversity, inclusion, and a shared sense of belonging</a>. For those companies that have already implemented clearly defined action steps, the board evaluation represents an opportunity to revisit the effectiveness of the company’s diversity and inclusion programs and reestablish their importance within the organizational mission. For those that are coming up to speed, there will need to be a call to action and a clearly articulated diversity and inclusion commitment from the top of the house. Some relevant questions for the board evaluation to examine include:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">How does the company’s culture support or inhibit an inclusive, diverse work environment?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Where does bias sit within the organization, its processes, recruitment, and talent pipeline?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What are the company’s development and philanthropic efforts in the minority community?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Does the company have a minority supplier program, and if so, how effective is it?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Where has the company missed out on the value that a more diverse workforce can bring?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What is the board’s need for education on this most critical topic?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">How will the company put a concrete action plan into place to ensure accountability?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">What are the implications of diversity, equity, and inclusion for the board’s composition and culture?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Process Recommendations</h3>
First and foremost, as with any standard board evaluation, ensuring the utmost candor from directors is critical, and the process for soliciting input will have a significant impact on this.  Whether performed by a lead director, nominating and governance committee chair, or an outside facilitator, board members must feel that their evaluation input will be kept in confidence, and that the process for summarizing the themes will be balanced and unfiltered by other agendas. Given that board evaluations this year will most likely need to be conducted virtually rather than in-person, the video or audio technology selected must be completely secure.

Second, it is recommended that confidential management input be included from those members of the management team who have interacted with the board and its committees. That input can be collected through both an online survey and through interviews conducted by the point person doing the evaluation. It is easy to overlook the shadow the board casts on the senior team for good or ill and to miss opportunities for the board to make an even greater contribution to the organization. Senior executives offer perspective and insights on board functioning and impact, that typically do not emerge (or the implications are less clear) when the input is solely limited to board members.

Third, it is recommended that a self-evaluation be completed by each director assessing how they contributed during the year and how they might add more value in the future. This encourages self-reflection, creates the expectation that evolution and adaptation is a natural part of the role, and sets the stage for a candid and constructive discussion regarding how to maximize the value they bring to the board moving forward. While not yet completed by the majority of boards, there is also a best-practice trend toward soliciting feedback for individual directors as part of the board-renewal process.

Finally, the board should set aside sufficient time on the agenda to discuss the results of the evaluation and their reactions, identify next steps, and build in a follow-up process to track the execution of the action steps. This discussion may take more time than might be typical when discussing the results of past board evaluations, given the chance to learn and grow from this once-in-a-lifetime confluence of events. Depending upon what the board evaluation highlights, the next steps may range from diving more deeply into a key issue as a board to specific actions that can be implemented by a committee, board leadership, or individual directors. The key is to ensure that the board actually evolves based on what it has learned from the process.

As our colleague, Joanna Starek, noted in a recent <i>Corporate Board Member</i> article “Twenty-First Century Leadership for Twenty-First Century Problems,” the complex, rapidly emerging issues of this century require a significantly different approach to problem-solving than in the past. We are globally connected in ways we are only beginning to appreciate. Today’s and tomorrow’s issues require not the heroic individual leaders of yore, but collaborative leaders who actively embrace complexity, surface root causes of systemic issues, and engage broader populations. The need to challenge cherished but divisive or limiting assumptions and mindsets and find new solutions will also extend into the boardroom.

While an annual board evaluation is a standard step taken by most boards, rethinking the approach to this year’s process will help to ensure that the boards and companies do not just survive these experiences, but are able to adapt and thrive because of them.  Implementing these recommendations will enable a board to do a meaningful, relevant assessment of both its strengths and opportunities to further its value and contribution in guiding and overseeing the organization it is charged with directing. Individual directors, board leaders, and the board as a whole need to ensure they are evolving faster, or at least as quickly, as the companies they govern.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/the-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-leader-scaling-leadership-in-real-time-part-3/">previous article</a> on the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) leader examined the leadership impact that DEI leaders can have when it comes to Leading People. In this final blog post, <a title="" href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/RFS-Model.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RHR’s Readiness for Scale<sup>SM</sup></a> model will be used to highlight competencies like Reasoning with Agility, Thriving in High Stakes, and Knowing Self. Problem-solving, remaining calm under pressure, and self-awareness in a complex role are the high-level areas of focus for this fourth dimension, <b>Leading Self</b>.
<h2>LEADING SELF</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>
<h3>Reasoning With Agility</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<b>What It Means:</b> Connecting ideas and information in a flexible and fluid manner and learning and integrating new information in ever-changing circumstances.

<b>What It Looks Like Right Now:</b> Today’s DEI leaders are asking themselves questions like: How do we make DEI learning experiences impactful in a virtual environment? What does it mean to <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">create a culture of belonging</a> for both politically conservative and liberal voices in the workplace? How long would it take to create pay equity in our organization, and what is the path to get there? <i>Analytical</i> is a word that is often used to describe a leader who demonstrates strengths when it comes to problem-solving skills. Yet being able to make sense of increasingly complex information is just one aspect of this competency. What sets leaders apart in this area is their ability to recognize their own gaps in knowledge and to know when to bring experts to the table to help solve problems. In a period of rapid change, DEI leaders must show up as a student and facilitate conversations that invite a variety of stakeholders into the process.
<ol start="2">
 	<li>
<h3>Thriving in High Stakes</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<b>What It Means:</b> Sustainably performing with stamina and consistency under intense pressure and pace.

<b>What It Looks Like Right Now:</b> Executing with scarce resources and managing steady resistance have often been recipes for burnout for a DEI leader. Add a pandemic and the brighter spotlight on this role, and these leaders are at even greater risk. I recently listened in on a webinar where a chief diversity officer discussed the toll of last six months on her health. For the first time in her life she was experiencing panic attacks. Her doctor informed her that she needed to make some changes fast. When <a href="https://www.executivebench.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Executive Bench®</a> consultants assess leaders along this dimension, clear signs of challenges often point to a leader’s inability to remain composed under pressure. Although this can be the case for a DEI leader, right now, the clear sign is their inability to keep pace physically and mentally with the varied demands of the role.
<ol start="3">
 	<li>
<h3>Knowing Self</h3>
</li>
</ol>
<b>What It Means:</b> <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-assessment/">Understanding and appreciating implications of their leadership style</a> amid broadening power and influence.

<b>What It Looks Like Right Now:</b> Much of this competency is related to self-awareness, but Executive Bench consultants also pay close attention to <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">how a leader leverages feedback for their own development</a>. Like many senior leaders, the opportunities for input are limited and can yield feedback that is vague. Fortunately, DEI leaders can capitalize on the increase in DEI efforts by asking for real-time feedback from stakeholders, peers, and direct reports. DEI leaders are finding themselves moderating town hall meetings, partnering with stakeholders across the organization on myriad policies and processes, and coaching executives. DEI leaders are presented with several opportunities to seek feedback on their influencing skills, business lens, decision-making approach, and strategic mindset. Leaders who score high in Knowing Self often seek out feedback as opposed to waiting for the normal channels like a performance review. More importantly, they take action on the feedback to improve their impact.

As shared in the <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/the-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-leader-scaling-leadership-in-real-time/">introductory post</a>, RHR’s Executive Bench has assessed leaders in the DEI discipline. Our Readiness for Scale model has played a critical role in helping hiring managers make selection decisions and <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-assessment/">helping HR executives assess their talent</a> pipelines in the DEI function. It is our hope that this blog series helps provide a new mental model when making talent decisions for DEI leaders.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From <b>Myspace to Kodak to Blockbuster to taxi cabs</b>, management textbooks are littered with examples of businesses that were blindsided by emerging trends. In many cases, they went from endangered to extinct in the blink of an eye. On the other end of the spectrum are companies that were able to anticipate a seismic shift on the horizon and evolve to capitalize on an industry-leading position.

How does this happen? Well, we’ve all been in situations where we fail to take in new information because we believe things are going well. Or we scan the landscape only for information that confirms that we are on the right course. There are also times when we are under external pressure to make a decision quickly, and we fail to fully appreciate the complexity of the situation before us. These events have something in common—a lack of flexibility that often comes back to haunt us. This is particularly relevant given the current market conditions. Some companies, however, evolve and adapt, responding to business opportunities presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and accelerating into innovative new markets, as discussed in a recent <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/the-new-normal-is-now/">blog post</a> by our colleagues.

While many factors contribute to organizational behemoths facing extinction, we believe that <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-teams/">having the right mindset among your team is even more critical</a> right now. Companies that accelerate performance from this downturn will have read the landscape accurately and pivoted to adapt to the new environment. What differentiates those who will be successful from those who are stagnant, is operating on a conceptual level—in the “what-if” space—and staying there long enough to engage in second- and third- order thinking.

<b>How can you start operating in this “what-if” space?  </b>

There are ways for your team to find that perfect blend between conceptual flexibility and decisiveness, the sweet spot that combats inertia and allows disruptive ideas to germinate. Cognitive science tells us that there are at least four levels of flexibility when solving problems:

<b>At the base level we are:</b>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">In love with our existing ideas and frameworks. We fail to gather information that might encourage an alternative approach.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Prone to adopt a single plan or strategy and work only within this framework.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Bound by our presuppositions, living in a comfy echo chamber.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Viewed by our peers as having one-track minds.</li>
</ul>
<b>At mid-level we:</b>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Cast a wide net, searching for information from a broad range of sources inside and outside of our industry and competitor cohort.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">View problems and issues from a variety of perspectives.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Enlist others in generating more than one plan of attack for an operational or market challenge or opportunity.</li>
</ul>
<b>At the upper level we:</b>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Break free from preconceptions.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Solicit and welcome fresh ideas or concepts that conflict with our initial thoughts.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Realize that our map is not the territory.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Sustain support for alternative proposals while determining the best solution.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Maintain flexibility to adapt and modify the idea as our chosen plan plays out.</li>
</ul>
<b>At the very top of the spectrum our teams:</b>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Consistently demonstrate a high level of openness to data, feedback, and ideas and take what we learn to drive new market opportunities.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Are ahead of the curve, continually scanning the environment for emerging trends within and outside of our immediate landscape that may turn the playing field upside down.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Maximize their degrees of freedom and are not bound by previous thinking; operate on multiple tracks or even fly above the rails to add a third dimension to their thinking.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Are <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">learning, growing, and adapting even as planned solutions play out</a>…and ingrain this mindset into the culture of the entire organization.</li>
</ul>
<b>To keep your team and culture at the top of the spectrum:</b>
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1">Carve out time regularly as an executive team to examine macro trends and play out scenarios regarding potential disruption to business as usual.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Actively engage others around key challenges through direct questioning, probing, and brainstorming. Ask, “Have we conducted a broad enough search?”</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Establish processes to pull for multiple solutions to every issue. Ask, “What other options do we have? How will each solution play out?”</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Normalize the notion that the plan is always a work in progress and will need constant mid-course corrections.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Root out confirmation bias; look for signs where emotions are playing a role in decision making; teach and model emotional detachment from the chosen path.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Set up an informal competition for finding weak signals.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Face emerging data with objectivity.</li>
</ol>
As you continue to adapt your business model to capitalize on the new normal, you and your team will benefit from developing conceptual flexibility and taking a higher road versus becoming endangered.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While the world’s scientists have known for decades that a warming planet will cause environmental degradation, social unrest, and economic losses, the world’s leaders have been slow to act. Now, we are seeing some of the most catastrophic consequences of inaction and industrial stagnation in the form of severe flooding, super storms, massive fires, unprecedented species extinction, and displacement of people and industry worldwide.

The time to act is now. RHR International is proud to announce that we are teaming up with TED talks, Future Stewards, and a growing number of global companies and global leaders to begin to COUNTDOWN the next 10 years of transformation to a more sustainable and just world.

This work will kick off Saturday, October 10, 2020 with a worldwide conference <a target="_blank" href="https://countdown.ted.com/global-launch/program/" rel="noopener">featuring leaders, activists, innovators, and entertainers.</a> The topics will include some of the most innovative and exciting work on energy, food, materials, transportation, and the role of nature in creating new economies and new opportunities for people everywhere.

Creating solutions to the climate crisis will take all of us. At RHR, we believe that leadership is a noble endeavor, and done well, is a force for good in the world. We believe that inside of this crisis is an opportunity to unlock new and <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-founder/">innovative leadership</a> for the benefit of all people and the planet.

<a href="https://countdown.ted.com/">COUNTDOWN 2020</a> is open to anyone! We hope you’ll join us!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/the-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-leader-scaling-leadership-in-real-time-part-2/">previous article</a> on the diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) leader looked at the first dimension in RHR’s Readiness for ScaleSM model and how these competencies are demonstrated in the DEI leader role. This third article highlights the leadership impact that DEI leaders can have when it comes to <b>Leading People</b>, the second dimension in the RFS model, which involves three competencies: Focusing the Enterprise, Influencing with Power, and Creating Shared Values. In summary, it is the way in which a leader is able to allocate resources and align people to achieve business goals.
<h2><strong>LEADING PEOPLE</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>​1. Focusing the Enterprise</strong></h3>
​<b>What It Means:</b> Driving clarity and alignment among all constituent groups across the enterprise.

<b>What It Looks Like Right Now:</b> Coming into 2020, many DEI leaders had a set of priorities and metrics they were focused on for their organizations. By the end of April, most of their budgets were frozen or significantly decreased. By the end of June, the C-suite was looking for ways to invest in DEI efforts as protests gained momentum across the country. What is of great importance at this time for the DEI leader is their ability to articulate a clear set of priorities and allocate appropriate resources with a level of flexibility. Some DEI leaders have doubled down on their existing commitments. Other DEI executives may shift their efforts from <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">increasing supplier diversity to increasing boardroom diversity</a>, for example. Equally important is the DEI leader’s ability to provide focus to their team by being a buffer so they can keep their eyes on the outlined priorities. When we assess leaders who score high in this competency, we often hear phrases like, “She is willing to push back on requests that are out of our scope,” or “He meets with stakeholders to ensure alignment and minimize conflicting agendas.” This type of leader creates the level of clarity needed for their team to deliver results.
<ol start="2">
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Influencing with Power</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
​<b>What It Means:</b> Delivering compelling messages that galvanize people and move stakeholders to action.

<b>What It Looks Like Right Now:</b> DEI executives and leaders have often been able to make a powerful case for DEI and have been able to do so across a wide audience with varying needs. What is different for the DEI leader in this season is how their coalition of support has shifted. Stakeholders who were passively opposed to DEI efforts may have started to turn the corner. Others who were champions may be concerned that even more will be asked of them with shrinking resources. For example, companies like <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-diversity-report-women-workforce-2019-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-adds-new-hiring-goal-to-boost-black-executives-11592421504" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PepsiCo</a> are sticking to their DEI hiring goals despite the realities of the pandemic. In a situation like this, DEI leaders have to understand the needs of critical stakeholders like talent acquisition executives and hiring managers. The ability to recognize unique concerns and communication styles of individual stakeholders is essential to moving them toward action.
<ol start="3">
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Creating Shared Values</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<b>What It Means:</b> Boldly setting the tone—from the top—that shapes decisions, behaviors, and interactions throughout the enterprise.

<b>What It Looks Like Right Now:</b> This competency speaks to a variety of behaviors that influence the work environment of the individuals whom the DEI leader directly and indirectly leads. In its very basic form, it is how a DEI leader communicates expectations, establishes guardrails for behavior, and conducts the difficult conversations to ensure full engagement. What is most distinctive and challenging for DEI leaders in large organizations is the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/demand-for-chief-diversity-officers-is-high-so-is-turnover-11594638000?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited amount of time</a> these individuals serve in this role (typically three years). Leaders can find themselves walking into a team environment that is running on empty and bracing itself for yet another leadership style to embrace. When layering on the pandemic, new occupants of this role have to <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-teams/">quickly create a team culture</a> and do so in a strictly virtual environment. We have found that leaders who score high in this area have a clear set of personal values that are consistent with how they communicate and work with their teams. This is critical when leaders have to quickly build or reinvent a team.

In the <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/the-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-leader-scaling-leadership-in-real-time-part-4/">fourth and final post of this series</a>, we will highlight what we have learned about how <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">scalable leaders problem solve</a>, excel under pressure, and build self-awareness. All of these behaviors are included in Leading Self, the third dimension in the RFS model.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the last few months, many leaders and organizations have become increasingly aware that despite the best intentions, their efforts to address diversity, inclusion and belonging (DI&amp;B) have been insufficient. Recent events have awakened the urgency to do more, differently, and to challenge beliefs, assumptions, and behaviors rooted in layers on layers of systemic and structural racism. This is happening at a much broader level than ever before, and many organizations have been trying to understand how to address DI&amp;B more deeply and more effectively.

As individuals, we have been considering the many things we can do to continue to change and build a more just and inclusive social fabric. As leaders, we are in a position where we have the ability to challenge and drive systemic changes within our organizations. Addressing DI&amp;B at a deeper level in organizations is absolutely the right thing to do, and it also positions organizations more competitively. <a href="https://www.edelman.com/research/brand-trust-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Today’s consumers</a> have been paying closer attention to brands and organizations that support diversity and inclusion-related change. In addition, <a href="https://images.forbes.com/forbesinsights/StudyPDFs/Innovation_Through_Diversity.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a> points to <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">diversity and inclusion as a key factor</a> influencing innovation in organizations. Organizations must also be concerned about looking at DI&amp;B more holistically—meaning not as a collection of isolated transactional events, but as a strategic direction that is embedded in its systems that can guide people, leaders, and teams on how to behave and operate.
<h3>How Can Organizations Begin or Shift The Way They Are Doing DI&amp;B Work?</h3>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>At an individual level</b>, <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">organizations need to focus on building opportunities</a> that enable people to look deeper into their rooted beliefs and to increase their awareness around how they may or may not be perpetuating DI&amp;B challenges. They need to create a safe space for courageous self-discovery, empathy building, and dialogue around uncomfortable truths. They need to encourage a growth mindset around DI&amp;B while also empowering individuals to take meaningful action. For example, by engaging in deeper facilitated experiences, a leader may come to understand their perspectives and accomplishments through a lens of relative privilege as well as begin to see through the lenses of others.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">However, this rich individual process can get lost or dispersed if organizations fail to create a common language and pathways for people to transition from “I” to “us,” as well if they fail to provide the tools to appropriately ensure accountability and continuity. <b>At a group level</b>, this shift from “I” to “us” starts at the top, with leaders reevaluating group values and modeling the behaviors the organization wants to see, as well as employing more inclusive practices into their team dynamics. For example, top leaders need to demonstrate how they enable all voices to be heard at team meetings and respectfully challenge when someone is excluded.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>At an organizational level</b>, a much deeper systemic impact is made when organizations create structural changes to facilitate the shift between “us” to a much more strategic, company-wide “us<i>.</i>” Organizations can do this by assessing how their operating culture may or may not support the DI&amp;B practices and behaviors they want to espouse. Then, organizations need to thoughtfully build their desired DI&amp;B vision into the org strategy and scorecard, and consider which organizational levers and measures should be employed to drive consistent, sustainable progress toward their strategic DI&amp;B goals. For example, “enabling all voices to be heard” would now come with built-in mechanisms that force behaviors to cascade across the organization and be elevated to performance expectations. The goal is that over time, DI&amp;B-related expectations become part of the operating culture of organizations.</li>
</ul>
Sustainable DI&amp;B is ultimately possible when it is incorporated more deeply and holistically into how we interact and lead and when it becomes part of the DNA of organizations.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You look around your table, pleased. Your senior team looks great. Lots of diversity there—not just in gender and ethnicity but also in background, viewpoint, and expertise. And you haven’t just made sure that your members are diverse; you’ve made it clear that everybody sitting at the table is part of the team and that they can make a valuable contribution.

You haven’t just checked the “diversity” and “inclusion” boxes. You understand the value of those elements in <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-teams/">fostering a high-performing team</a>.

So it’s all great, right?

Right?

Not necessarily.

Understandably, leaders would think that this kind of scenario ensures that the <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">benefits of diversity and inclusion</a> will naturally proceed. After all, that’s what’s implied by so many experts in the field. But in the work we have done with senior teams across numerous industries and geographies, we have found that there is more to the picture. High-performing teams have additional attributes that make diversity valuable in the way they work.
<h2>Diversity, Check. Inclusion, Check. What About Belonging?</h2>
The additional attributes that make the difference are rooted in the team member experience, not in the leader’s perception. Members of high-performing teams feel more than included: <b>there is a strong sense of belonging</b>. They aren’t just given a seat at the table; they know that they can safely contribute, challenge ideas, and weigh in on decisions without risking repercussions or retaliation.

What fosters the experience of belonging in team members? It’s a good question, and the right one for a leader to ask. We have noted three key cultural characteristics that influence belonging on a team: identity, power, and trust.
<ol>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Who are you? Who? Who?</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<i>Identity</i> comprises two parts. First is team identity, characterized by its reason for being—its purpose that answers “Why are we a team? What are we tasked with accomplishing? What could get in the way of us fulfilling our purpose?” A leader should engage with the team to answer these questions.

Second, this same understanding—purpose and possible barriers—is also crucial for each team member. Individuals on a team should know “What value do I bring to the team? How do my viewpoint and background contribute to the team’s purpose? What biases or assumptions do I have that might get in the way of working effectively with the other members?” A leader should also engage, this time with each individual, to arrive at these answers.
<ol start="2">
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Who’s got the power?</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<i>Power</i> impacts belonging in a diverse team in terms of the dynamics of influence. Who exerts influence in meetings and the decision-making process? Where do individuals sit on the “power grid”? Is there a pattern that puts more-diverse members toward the bottom of that grid, where they have little influence on decisions and actions? A leader needs to understand the team’s power dynamics and needs to eliminate patterns that diminish or block the power of certain members to influence team activities.
<ol start="3">
 	<li>
<h3><strong>In team we trust</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<i>Trust</i> is the secret sauce on any team, and on a diverse team, it can make the difference between good and great. We need to be safe to speak openly about our concerns, make mistakes and acknowledge them, and share stories about what matters most to us. In other words, we are confident that we can speak up without reprisal or retaliation and, further, that what we say will be heard and engaged with.

Each member needs to answer affirmatively to questions like “Do I believe the intentions of those around me? Am I willing to allow others to make decisions on my behalf? Will I be treated fairly if I give a little on my objectives so that the team can meet higher-level objectives?” A leader can be impactful by creating the space of psychological safety where team members are willing to engage with curiosity regarding others’ perspectives, to ask questions, and to synthesize viewpoints effectively. This will create a team that is open to ideas regardless of their source and one that can brainstorm in a meaningful way.
<h2>The Whole Picture, and Nothing But The Whole Picture</h2>
High-performing teams move beyond diversity and inclusion and form cultures in which every member knows they belong. With clear identity, equitable power structure, and mutual trust among the members, such teams can tap into the benefits of diversity in meaningful and constructive ways.

<b>Diversity</b> plus <b>inclusion</b> plus <b>belonging</b> is the whole picture. Identity, power, and trust add the details that make the picture work.

Be an artist. Create the whole picture with your senior team. You’ll see significant impacts from the effort.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[RHR has continued to connect with chief human resources officers in virtual roundtables as they navigate through the challenges of the pandemic and the resulting impact on organizations and the economy. CHROs from various industries including retail, food manufacturing, luxury consumer goods, technology, and energy have participated in these roundtables. This current round of discussions revealed that in addition to the practical issues of dealing with uncertainty and the way forward, CHROs are now facing a broader set of challenging societal questions. Here are some themes that have emerged:
<h2>Getting The Best of Both: Balancing Home Working With Office Working</h2>
<h4><b>As firms have become accustomed to working from home (WFH) and to the new virtual operating environment, the focus for CHROs is to try and get the best of both while also anticipating future challenges.</b></h4>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Many people have embraced WFH, but they are discovering that it is much harder to have complex and nuanced leadership discussions virtually.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Organizations are moving toward flexible WFH arrangements. The challenge faced by CHROs is how to get the upsides of working in offices (social connections) while giving people the freedom to WFH. Team on-sites are becoming the new trend.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">An emerging and critical challenge for the future is determining how to maintain an organization's culture and how this will work with new hires.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Significant Transformational Moments Like COVID and The Black Lives Matter (BLM) Movement Are Putting CHROs in The Vanguard of Change</h3>
<h4><b>There is a palpable belief that change needs to happen and that there is no going back. CHROs and chief executive officers are at the forefront of embracing a change agenda.</b></h4>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">COVID and the BLM movement are dovetailing together and highlighting potential inequalities. They also provide opportunities for change, e.g., <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">increasing diversity within hiring practices</a> because a candidate’s geographical location may not matter with the ability to work from home.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Many CHROs feel that a change in the way we work must happen now and is no longer a choice.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Like never before, there is a requirement for CEOs and CHROs to demonstrate visible leadership; there is an opportunity for HR to move away from being seen as the “mask police” to becoming real drivers of change.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">CHROs are reporting that they feel like they are going from one crisis to the next and are on call 24/7. As change architects, they need to manage their own energy levels, watch for fatigue and burnout, and ensure they are sufficiently long-term focused.</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Key Priority for CHROs Continues to be Maintaining Engagement Through Transparency and Authenticity</h3>
<h4><b>As leaders continue to inform, connect, unite, and guide, it is the companies that live their values and walk the talk that are driving the highest levels of engagement.</b></h4>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">The CHROs we spoke with said that, despite the challenges, employee surveys have continued to be positive. <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">Organizations continue to build trust and engagement</a> and are seen as handling the crisis sensitively.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">As organizations move out of crisis-management mode, demonstrating transparency and listening continue to be important. Many CHROs reported the benefits of deliberately using less policy and corporate speak and being less structured and authentic in their communication, which sets the tone for listening without an agenda.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Best practices of transparency include CEOs recording videos to send to employees, employees having a voice in corporate live-video sessions, and leaders holding all-hands meetings where they are able to listen and have transparent conversations about what’s going on.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Challenges of Long-Term Planning and Remuneration Continue to Be Front and Center for CHROs</h3>
<h4><b>There seems to be no clear answers on the best way forward. Organizations are adopting different approaches.</b></h4>
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">A number of companies are holding off on compensation decisions until later in the year.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Where compensation reductions have been implemented, they seem to be at the director and management-team levels, mainly through bonus reductions.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Targets for next year are hard to set. Some organizations are moving to a short-term, six-month horizon, while others have kept the target the same.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have been <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">advising</a> our chief executive officer clients individually as well as bringing them together in intimate, transparent forums to share experiences and updates on how they are leading through this phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Black Lives Matter movement and social inequity, and ongoing business instability and unpredictability. Here are some themes that have emerged:
<h2>Planning is unpredictable, so plan for the worst and hope for the best, but be bold about how you want to come out of this crisis.</h2>
All our CEOs are engaged in ongoing business-scenario planning with an increased set of variables. From consumer confidence dipping to a highly variable regulatory environment to workforces that are being physically and mentally stretched thin, CEOs are wearing multiple hats. One commented, “I’m more a therapist and health executive than a CEO these days.”

With consumer confidence dropping, these executives are planning for the worst but also strategically investing in rapidly emerging trends (e.g., brand awareness, e-commerce, sustainability, and work from home as a permanent option). Several questioned how bold they could be so that they can emerge from these crises stronger than when they went in.

Ultimately, they are tightly managing costs and maintaining as much flexibility as they can given the unpredictability of the next six to 24 months.
<h2>Black Lives Matter and social inequity issues are taking precedence and <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">shaping culture</a>.</h2>
Rapidly engaging with employees through roundtable discussions has greatly impacted many CEOs as they take a deep dive into the topic of racism, the felt experience of Black employees, and the cultural implications for their organizations.

CEOs are shifting their time to spend more of it on culture—some as much as 40% given the intensity of the issues around racism and how much dialogue, understanding, and action are needed to find and solve root causes and to shift the dynamic in their organizations and community.

In addition to their own soul-searching, CEOs are acknowledging and owning their lack of progress and making public commitments around diversity metrics to their boards, investors, and employees. More than in the past, CEOs are raising their own accountability bar—for <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">themselves and their organizations</a>.
<h2>Although not sure they signed up for it, they are rapidly learning and adapting to the new realities.</h2>
It’s hard to ignore how CEOs are going through their own personal journeys as they reflect on their business challenges and opportunities. A theme emerged around how much they are having to <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">shift their leadership</a> to be more transparent, open, and purpose driven about their personal views of not just business but also society and politics at large. Every statement and every move feel scrutinized from these lenses; whereas for many of them, they learned their craft when only one stakeholder reigned supreme: the investor. Learning this new skillset is both exhausting and exhilarating for them; in the end, they are taking on these new challenges as opportunities to grow themselves and their organizations.

<b>The takeaway:</b> creating space for these transparent, honest discussions is key to displaying resilience in the face of change. CEOs today are stepping up to the plate and asking the right questions to tackle the unprecedented issues they are facing head-on.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/the-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-leader-scaling-leadership-in-real-time/">previous blog post</a> in this series was intended to set the stage regarding the drivers that have accelerated the need for <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion</a> (DEI) leaders to grow their leadership capacity. This series offers DEI leaders a mental model to assess their strengths and gaps. In addition, we believe CEOs and CHROs in search of their organization’s first DEI leader can use RHR’s Readiness for Scale℠ assessment model as a guide. The <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-assessment/">model</a> consists of three dimensions: Leading Business, Leading People, and Leading Self. In this second of four articles, we will look at Leading Business, which includes three competencies: Seeing the Whole, Making Systems Decisions, and Leading the Future. Our <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-assessment/">Executive Bench®</a> program consultants view these competencies as the strategic choices an individual makes as a leader. In summary, it is where leaders get their information to inform thinking and how they make decisions and take action on multiple time horizons.
<h2>Leading Business</h2>
<ol>
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Seeing the Whole</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<b>What It Means:</b> Translating the broader landscape (enterprise, market, industry, regulatory, customer) into behaviors and actions that will drive enterprise objectives.

<b>What It Looks Like Right Now:</b> DEI leaders who held business-line positions in the past, and those who were closer to the business in HR roles naturally understand internal business drivers and seek external data to help them frame solutions. This internal/external lens also helps them quickly see the impacts of enterprise-wide decisions that inhibit inclusive work environments. From changes in a company’s operations to local mask requirements that can impact the hearing impaired, there is an avalanche of data that must be digested. Leaders who excel in this competency can integrate disparate pieces of information and zero in on the data most critical to help shape and articulate clear ideas.
<ol start="2">
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Making Systems Decisions</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<b>What It Means: </b>Moving to decisions in the face of enterprise-level risk, competing priorities, limited resources, and diverse stakeholders.

<b>What It Looks Like Right Now</b>: DEI leaders who score high in this area are comfortable with risks, can evaluate the complexity of a decision, and move decisively without complete data. Within a week, Juneteenth, a celebration most of mainstream America had never heard of, turned into company holidays across the United States. Some of these companies only recently observed Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, which has been an American federal holiday since 1986. DEI leaders at these companies had to quickly understand the downstream (e.g., operations, communication protocols) impacts of this type of decision and comfortably accept the reputational risk associated with supporting or not supporting such a decision.
<ol start="3">
 	<li>
<h3><strong>Leading the Future</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<b>What It Means</b>: Balancing the need to build confidence and drive outcomes in the near term with building momentum and capability for the long term.

<b>What It Looks Like Right Now</b>: For DEI leaders with a strategic plan being executed, they are in a good position to respond right now. In fact, as one of my DEI strategist friends told me last week, “We are telling our clients that <i>now</i>, as your CEO and CHRO are asking, ‘What should we be doing to move the needle on this?’ is <i>the best</i> time to reintroduce that strategic plan.” DEI leaders who can scale their leadership understand that long-term work is where the sustainable change will occur—after Americans have adapted to a COVID-19 existence and when the protests have decreased. Bringing attention to accessibility technology, shoring up DEI data analytics capability, and rolling out unconscious bias training for recruiters are examples of longer-term goals. As companies are in reactive mode, the long-term view is just as critical as the shifting short-term priorities.

Just as we released the introductory blog post, a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> article discussed the realities of limited resources and the level of influencing required by the chief diversity officer role. The <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/the-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-leader-scaling-leadership-in-real-time-part-3/">next post in this series</a> will look at the critical competencies related to these topics in the Leading People dimension of the Readiness for Scale model.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the current business environment, there is a plethora of tips and advice on how to communicate remotely in light of the COVID-19 virus. Much of the challenge as we switch to virtual working relates to connecting with people in a way that helps them feel cared for and gives them a sense of <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">belonging</a>. However, this is not a new issue, and while the current situation has put this into sharp relief, it is a key challenge for many senior leaders.
<h2><strong>As they progress to more senior levels, how do senior leaders scale their impact and intimacy?</strong></h2>
We know from research that connecting with someone in an intimate way drives a sense of belonging, engagement, and ultimately performance. The challenge of scaling intimacy is therefore paramount for many leaders, particularly as they work across the enterprise.
<h3><strong>STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE COMPONENTS OF INTIMACY AND WHERE YOU ARE STARTING FROM</strong></h3>
Executives need to ask themselves how intimate and connected they are with their teams. Interestingly, it is not an easy question for executives to answer. When working with individuals and teams, we often use a <b>trust equation</b> whereby we lay out intimacy in more detail.

<b>Trust = Intimacy x Competence/Risk</b>

A simple but powerful exercise is to ask executives to rate local and extended teams on each of the following dimensions of intimacy:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Affection: </b>How much do you show you care about this person?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Collaboration: </b>Do you collaborate effectively together?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Conflict:</b> Do you engage in constructive conflict?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Transparency: </b>How much do you reveal thoughts and feelings to, and share information with, this person, <i>and is it mutual</i>?</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Predictability: </b>Are you consistent and predictable in your actions toward them?</li>
</ul>
The lower the score, the more the executive needs to think about the levers they can pull to build intimate, close relationships.
<h3><strong>STEP 2: DEMONSTRATE THE COMPONENTS OF INTIMACY</strong></h3>
<b>Know what you care about and show it.</b>

A basic factor for many is knowing that their leaders care about them and the business. This helps motivate and engage people and connect them to their leaders. At RHR, <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-assessment/">we assess</a> a lot of leaders and a question we often ask is, “<b><i>What do you care about, and more importantly, how do people know you care</i></b><b>?</b>” It is surprising how many leaders struggle to answer these questions—not because they don’t care, but because they haven’t asked the question or stopped long enough to reflect on an answer. <i>An important first step in demonstrating intimacy is being clear about what you care about as an individual and as leader</i>.
<h2><strong>Promote collaboration by highlighting what binds people together.</strong></h2>
It is important for leaders to pull people together, and one of the best ways of doing this is highlighting what binds them together—their common purpose. At an individual level, being clear about purpose helps  leaders show what they uniquely bring to the table, but at an organizational level, this promotes greater collaboration. It starts with <i>why </i>we do what we do. By talking about <i>why</i>, leaders create context so people see the value in what they are doing and feel part of something more meaningful and united. In a recent MIT study, 80% of the sense of purpose within the organization was generated by 20% of the leaders, which suggests that this is not something leaders are particularly good at. <i>Leaders should talk about the </i>why<i> and emphasize the connectedness to their industry, their company, their customers, and each other.</i>
<h2><strong>Engage in constructive conflict.</strong></h2>
Being engaged in constructive conflict can bring people closer together rather than further apart. Many leaders avoid conflict because they care. In reality, models such as <b>Radical Candor </b>highlight that good conflict management occurs at the intersection of caring personally and challenging directly. Caring personally means you care about the other person, not about whether you are winning a popularity contest. Challenging directly means you share your perspective and invite the other person to do the same. <i>Intimate leaders engage in constructive conflict.</i>

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1626" src="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Radical-Candor-300x185.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="185" />
<h2><strong>Transparently share thoughts and feelings by leveraging storytelling.</strong></h2>
Authentically revealing thoughts and feelings across the enterprise is critical to building intimacy at scale. However, it is often very difficult for leaders with large egos and high achievement drives to admit mistakes. They might share their thoughts, but they are less likely to share their feelings. One of the most impactful and simplest ways of sharing feelings and demonstrating vulnerability is through storytelling. A culture of storytelling creates a great deal of intimacy. Leaders need to think about how to embed stories into their communications and meetings—for example, by highlighting stories on video or newsletters. Stories have the ability to drive the right behaviors and to connect people to similar experiences as well. For example, telling stories about partnership, risk-taking, or failures is a nice way to highlight one’s similarities with others. <i>Share thoughts and feelings through stories and create a culture of storytelling.</i>

Storytelling is as much a science as it is an art, and senior leaders need to become familiar with the formula, including:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Critical signposting—make it interesting and give it a headline: </b>Be clear in your mind how you want the other person to think, feel, and act at the end of your communication.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Bring the characters to life: </b>Make it personal (be mindful of being a central character and use it as a vehicle to highlight vulnerability).</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Create a mental picture for your audience; add substance; create credibility: </b>Add details, outcomes, results, and feedback as you tell the story; don’t overdo the content or get distracted.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Be clear on the takeaway: </b>Be clear on the call to action, the implications, and the “so what?”</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Be consistent and predictable in actions.</strong></h2>
While for many this may be table stakes, it is a critical factor that builds intimacy and ultimately trust. People want their leaders to be consistent and predictable, as it feeds our intrinsic need for security. However, predictability is an underrated leadership capability and is often undervalued, especially in a world that champions agility. The reality is that predictability not only builds trust, but it also brings freedom for employees. If you can predict what your boss is going to do, it means you don't have to spend as much energy managing that relationship and justifying your actions. <i>Leaders need to be consistent and predictable. Start by being clear about your moral compass and what you stand for as a leader. Then, ask whether people can see this in the way you act.</i>
<h3><strong>STEP 3: LEVERAGE MULTIPLE VENUES AND TECHNOLOGY TO ENSURE SUSTAINED CONNECTIVITY</strong></h3>
It is important for executives to think about the venues and mediums they have to demonstrate intimacy; this can include newsletters, videos, group lunches, town halls, handwritten notes, informal gatherings, etc.

In the current environment, there is a lot of emphasis on connecting during virtual meetings. RHR recently produced an article <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/together-apart-teaming-through-a-time-of-social-distancing/">Together Apart: Teaming through a Time of Social Distancing</a>, which focuses on how to create intimacy virtually, such as celebrating anniversaries and showing other members of the team around your home office.

In addition to virtual meetings, executives should look to experiment with different technologies, such as WhatsApp, Basecamp, Google Jamboard, and Google Hangouts. A powerful and effective medium for executives to get their voice out to the rest of the organization is video vignettes. Keeping them short (two minutes), unedited (imperfect), and filmed on a phone gives them an authentic feel and provides the opportunity for executives to share what they are thinking and feeling. We recently worked with a leader who created and shared a personal video when he was promoted to the head of marketing. It was brief but heartfelt, and he talked about his and his family’s reaction to the COVID-19 crisis. It was an effective tool for immediately engaging the heart despite the scale and geography of the team. <i>Communicating at scale is about leveraging multiple venues and technologies.</i> <i>Leaders need to experiment</i>.
<h3><strong>STEP 4: BE DISCIPLINED AND FOCUSED, ESTABLISHING RITUALS THAT MAXIMIZE ENGAGEMENT</strong></h3>
One of the secrets of scaling leadership is to become more disciplined in reaching out and connecting with the wider organization. It’s a bit like Brownian motion—as the particles get further apart, there is less chance they collide. In the same way, leaders need to orchestrate closeness by deliberately and intentionally reaching out to ensure their messages are heard and understood. This is difficult for some, as they rely on their charisma, not on planning and scheduling, to create close connection.

To create a habit or ritual, repetition is key—start with something specific and measurable and then repeat it regularly. There are no hard-and-fast rules on what to do, other than the actions should be planned and recorded so they become repetitive. Tips include:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Create an internal stakeholder map</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Book time every Friday afternoon to connect with the top talent and find out what they care about</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Capture and record significant anniversaries</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Learn the names of your team members’ significant partners</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Every quarter/six months, visit those working on the shop floor and ask them for feedback</li>
</ul>
Scaling intimacy is not new; it is a key skill for all leaders, especially as they step into senior roles. It is about first understanding the components of intimacy and making sure these are regularly practiced so they become a habit or ritual, and then second, it is about experimentation and discipline to ensure it reaches across the organization.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The last decade has been good for private equity (PE). Since 2013,<a href="https://www.investmentcouncil.org/private-equity-faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> PE funds have invested more than $400 billion annually</a> in tens of thousands of American companies, and in 2019,<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/private%20equity%20and%20principal%20investors/our%20insights/mckinseys%20private%20markets%20annual%20review/mckinsey-global-private-markets-review-2020-v4.ashx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> the global PE industry’s asset value grew to nearly $4 trillion</a>. Executives who have made their names in listed companies and other traditional corporate environments are seeing this growth and looking at PE for new career opportunities.

Although there is definitely an appeal to running an organization that is privately owned, unencumbered by quarterly pressures from institutional investors and distanced from big-business bureaucracy, there are also drawbacks, and many leaders who have thrived in the past fail when they take over PE-backed firms. A lot of leadership development focuses on a leader’s ability to scale up and grow, but what is the secret to success when going from big to small? Here are some tips from those who have successfully made this transition:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Understand your role.</strong> As a leader, you are used to being, well, a leader. To state the obvious, successful leaders are good guides. You’ll still have to do this in a PE environment, but you need to learn how to manage in a different way. You’re moving from a traditional leadership role into more of a player-coach role. This means you have to be engaged, involved, and willing to roll up your sleeves to get much closer to the business. It is critical to balance thinking ahead and setting the plays with understanding the ones you need to run. Part of this means making sure that you are in lockstep with your PE board—check in frequently and make sure that you understand how to manage up as well as down.</li>
</ul>
This also means that there are limitations to moving as fast as you would like. Identify the most critical places where speed is needed and pace yourself. Avoid overloading a system that is not wired or ready to change as quickly as would be ideal. Successful leaders at portfolio companies know what detail to get into, when, how quickly to act, and when to elevate.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Expect process limitations.</strong> Often the hardest transition that leaders have when moving from big to small is adjusting to the scale. You are probably used to being surrounded by incredibly smart, senior people and having a lot of data to help you make decisions. A lot of these resources may be lacking in PE. People may need more guidance and hand-holding than you are used to. Be an active coach and be generous with feedback. In addition, you will need to figure out what data and processes you need to really run a streamlined business; allocate your resources to support those. Be flexible and understand what is good enough for right now. Trust your gut. You may need to be more comfortable with ambiguity than you are used to.</li>
</ul>
Gary Cohen, chief executive officer of Qualitor, Inc., says: “You probably need to do a lot yourself because the quantity and quality of resources you used to have [do] not exist in these companies. But you can rent it when really required, using lower-cost advisors and consultants, as you are building your organization and evaluating your resource needs.”
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Prioritize, prioritize, and prioritize again.</strong> In a typical corporate setting, a leader is used to running a lot of different plays at the same time. In PE, you’re going to be focused on fewer goals, with a much shorter timeline. The stakes are higher—you need to continue to generate cash while continuing to grow and adapt. Because your role requires you to be more hands-on, you may find yourself being pulled in many different directions. You have to quickly figure out what is the best and highest use of your time and then ensure that your entire organization knows its objectives and also prioritizes accordingly.</li>
</ul>
“Our team sets our annual priorities together,” Cohen adds. “As a senior team we review, align, and check in each quarter. I then summarize and provide to the private equity firm so they are clear on what my objectives are. We then have monthly operations reviews for each of our businesses units, and I have a weekly staff call with my direct reports to ensure that we are on track with prioritization.”
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Have a skilled bench.</strong> Talent is an important lever for value creation, and in PE, you need to add value to make money. Look at what the most critical roles are to help scale your organization and start there. Obviously, your chief financial officer is going to be extremely important in helping you perform month to month. Your most significant roles are going to be the ones focused on business performance and revenue generation on both the technical and sales sides of the business. Then, depending on your industry, you’ll look at additional roles. If you’re in tech, a chief technical officer may be crucial. If you are in manufacturing, a chief operating officer may be more important. As you grow, HR will become even more vital. Identify the value-driving roles in your organization and hire quickly.</li>
</ul>
Mark Alexander, CEO of Icelandic Provisions, and Doron Grosman, CEO of Global Container Terminals Inc., both agree that getting the right talent in place is critical.

“In PE, you can’t afford to have a B- or even a B-minus-level talent in any of the top-two tiers of your organization,” Grosman says. “Replace them with dignity and speed. Find the most experienced talent [who] can afford to support your investment strategy.”

Alexander adds: “Getting the leadership team right is absolutely critical to ensure quality, the pace of strategy, execution, and creating the right culture. Every position is that much more important in a leaner environment because more is expected of each individual and the impact of each individual is greater.”

At the end of the day, remember that your new teams don’t have the same breadth of experience as you do. For people who haven’t worked at scale or who have lived their lives in one or two small companies, they may not know what good looks like for a large-scale organization. Your job is to be a tutor on scaling—laying the groundwork on why you want to grow, helping people understand how to do it, and supporting them to think and act differently to get there.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Antonio Zappulla is the newly appointed CEO of the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the world’s leading news and information provider. Antonio joined the Thomson Reuters Foundation as director of Communications in 2013. In 2014, he was promoted to director of Strategy and Communications, and appointed chief operating officer in 2016, responsible for overseeing the Development, Communications, and Monitoring functions of the organization. An outspoken supporter of the business case for human rights, Antonio is the founder of </span><a href="https://www.openlynews.com/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Openly</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the world’s first global platform dedicated to coverage of LGBT+ stories with distribution to one billion Reuters clients daily. In 2018, Antonio ranked first in the OUTstanding list of third-sector LGBT executives published by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Financial Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2017, he was named a European Young Leader by Friends of Europe. In 2016, he was awarded the Talented Young Italians Award by the Italian Chamber of Commerce. Antonio is a One Young World Ambassador and a World Economic Forum agenda contributor. He chairs the board of AllOut and sits on the board of Out in Business at the London Business School.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Antonio spoke with RHR’s Orla Leonard about the purpose of the Thomson Reuters Foundation and how CEOs can advance LGBT+ inclusion in the workforce.</span>

<b>Orla:</b> <b>Congratulations on your new role as CEO of the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Help us understand the purpose of the Foundation and the impact it has on the global stage.</b>

<b>Antonio:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Foundation is the philanthropic arm of the world’s leading news and information provider, Thomson Reuters. The purpose of the Foundation is to leverage the core skills of Thomson Reuters for social good. We have a global team of journalists who shine a light on stories that are typically under-reported such as women’s rights, LGBT+ rights, slavery and trafficking, the human impact of climate change, food sustainability, and land and property rights. We are not in the space of advocacy journalism, but we believe it is important to raise awareness of the human impact of these social issues. We also believe that there is a strong link between a functioning democracy and a functioning media system.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That is why we train journalists around the world in accordance with the Trust Principles of Thomson Reuters. To this day, we have trained over 18,000 journalists in eleven languages in 165 countries. We also play a crucial role in spreading the rule of law. Through TrustLaw, the Foundation’s global pro bono legal program, we connect high-impact NGOs and social enterprises working to create social change with the best law firms and corporate legal teams around the world to provide them with free legal assistance.</span>

<b>Orla: We know that a significant aspect of your vision is to ensure a global platform dedicated to LGBT+ stories and perspectives. Tell us about that and why this is so important for the Foundation.</b>

<b>Antonio:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Our overarching purpose is to raise awareness of global issues that are either under-reported or reported inaccurately and with bias. If you take LGBT+ topics, they are widely reported across the globe in a biased and often derogatory way. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Openly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the world’s first global platform dedicated to fair and impartial coverage of LGBT+ stories with distribution to one billion Reuters clients daily. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Openly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reports these stories in a fair and impartial manner. At our recent launch of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Openly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we took the opportunity to raise awareness (on the front of our Times Square building!) of real headlines used to describe members of the LGBT+ community. They included the words: “devil worshippers” and calls for "them" to be hanged. This prompted the tagline for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Openly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “Impartial LGBT+ News for a World that Isn’t.” The website, </span><a href="http://openlynews.com/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">openlynews.com</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> represents a variety of LGBT+ news and topics in a fair and unbiased fashion allowing for information exchange and debate.  </span>

<b>Orla: You have recently arrived back from Davos, where the World Economic Forum (WEF) kicked off its first-ever LGBT+ project, highlighting the importance of inclusion, both as a core value and a business imperative. What’s the latest on how our world leaders are tackling this?</b>

<b>Antonio:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Two buzz words that were very present at this year’s WEF were “purpose” and “trust.” Paul Polman of Uniliver spoke about the importance of marrying the values and purpose of the company to the individual employee’s sense of purpose. The latest Edelman Barometer (2019) which was unveiled at Davos, showed that trust in business is growing. I think the Diversity &amp; Inclusion (D&amp;I) agenda is inextricably linked to both of these things. Employees want to see the companies they work for reflect the societies they live in. But the CEOs at Davos did not just speak about D&amp;I as the right move morally, they also provided some hard data on</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> why </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is in important for the bottom line. A 2014 World Bank study focused on India and found that anti-LGBT+ discrimination cost up to 30 billion U.S. dollars. In 2017, UNAIDS estimated the global cost of anti-LGBT+ discrimination at 100 billion USD annually. So, while there is work to do, it seems like Davos began to embrace the rainbow wave this year.</span>

<b>Orla: As a member of the LGBT+ community, what has your personal leadership journey been like? What were the key challenges/opportunities you faced and how did you lean into them?</b>

<b>Antonio:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I grew up as part of Generation X on the Italian island of Sicily. At that time, nobody was “out” in politics or the media. Therefore, I struggled to find a role model that I could relate to. Then, when I came to London to go to university, I found it much easier to connect with others in the LGBT+ community—there were places to go and people to meet, and I came out at 21. But then when I started working as a presenter for a London-based international Italian-language channel, the culture was very macho. Had I been honest about being gay, I think the dynamic on the team would have become so toxic that I would have had to leave. It was horrible. I had to lie every day about who I was for four long years! I dreaded coming into work on Monday and having to answer questions about how I had spent my weekend. I remember having to Google straight bars in London so I wouldn’t trip myself up. But my next job at the same company saw me working for an openly gay boss. In that team, difference was not just tolerated but valued, and I felt like I could bring my whole self to work again. I have no doubt that I performed better as a result.</span>

<b>Orla</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><b>What have been the key lessons you have learned that you would pass on to other LGBT+ leaders embarking on their leadership journey?</b>

<b>Antonio:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I think the main piece of advice is to reach out to people you can trust, whether they’re a boss, a colleague, or an HR person. It is not unusual for university graduates to go back into the closet when they start their first job, and I think that is because at university you have access to LGBT+ networks that may be less obvious in the workplace. If there is an LGBT+ network within your company, that can be a good place to start, but D&amp;I should be on everyone’s agenda. The more we can focus on inclusion broadly, the better.</span>

<b>Orla: What is the Foundation doing to address the diversity gap within your own employee population?</b>

<b>Antonio:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I think that because of what we do and our global nature, we have fertile ground for diversity. Our core staff of 100+ people includes 25 nationalities and we speak 17 different languages. We don’t set quotas but instead try to exhibit the right behaviors from the top. We have zero tolerance for any office “banter” or practices that negatively impact D&amp;I and clear HR policies in place to deal with them. When recruiting new staff, I specifically ask for educational background to be removed. I am more interested in what people can do than where they went to school, but I know that my personal bias could creep in when it comes to university choice; therefore, I strip that out. We also have a specific LGBT+ mentoring program and one of the consistent themes emerging is that people do not want to be seen as token LGBT+ players, but want to be judged, like everyone else, on their results. Finally, we have been intentional in enabling less-tenured people to jump a level so that we are hearing from more millennials at senior levels. This allows for a richer, more mixed debate on the business issues we face.</span>

<b>Orla</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: </span><b>As a new CEO, what are your top three suggestions for other CEOs to ensure a more diverse and inclusive workforce?</b>

<b>Antonio</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Decide upon a clear strategy and a D&amp;I policy and implement a zero-tolerance policy around it. Leapfrog your less tenured employees to ensure their input is added to the mix. Be a positive role model and ensure that those behaviors filter through to middle management. No matter what we espouse at the top, culture deeper down is where the rubber hits the road.</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Most executives want feedback—and complain when they don’t get it. But they seldom tell their manager.

In an ideal world, your manager would be having <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/executive-feedback-as-a-conversation/">regular feedback conversations</a> with you. If they aren’t, don’t assume silence means everything is going well—you might get blindsided in your annual performance review or overlooked for that promotion you covet or miss the chance to lead a high-profile task force. So how do you break the silence?

Breaking the Ice

When all else fails, ask for feedback but understand that for some people, <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/why-leaders-avoid-giving-feedback/">giving feedback is challenging</a>. Help the boss help you. A week before you meet, send three questions about the areas where you want to <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">grow</a> (e.g., “How can I be more strategic? How could I have ended that meeting on a better note? Where do my actions support or detract from the kind of culture we’re trying to create?”). This gives your manager a focus and some time to reflect and prepare. If your manager is a deep introvert, ask that your feedback be delivered via phone call or email.
<h3><b>Effective Receiving </b></h3>
<ol>
 	<li>Understand feedback <b>is a gift. </b>It’s a form of recognition and commitment to your development.</li>
 	<li><b>Say thank you</b> at the outset and at the end for taking the time on your behalf.</li>
 	<li>Mentally <b>prepare yourself to listen and understand</b> the feedback. Go in with an open mind and know that someone is genuinely trying to help you.</li>
 	<li><b>Clarify</b> where needed so you fully understand the feedback, but try to avoid pushing back or arguing if you disagree (at a minimum sleep on it if you have a different viewpoint, and really try to think through what they are sharing).</li>
 	<li><b>Ask if this is a derailer.</b> Ask whether the feedback is simply a suggestion or career guidance for a minor tweak or more along the lines of “improve this or your career is in jeopardy.”</li>
 	<li><b>Watch your body language</b>—crossed arms, a frown, and/or a sigh signal disagreement or a wish that the meeting was over.</li>
 	<li>Always bring something to take notes with...and then <b>take notes!</b></li>
 	<li><b>Take action: </b>Talk about a plan to act on the feedback before expressing your appreciation.</li>
 	<li>Ask what <b>articles or books </b>you should read to open your mind on a key subject.</li>
 	<li>Solicit feedback from <b>multiple viewpoints</b> whenever possible and on an ongoing basis, preferably in 360 fashion. Reflections from all over your organization at every level can be extremely valuable, especially from those who shoot straight with you.</li>
</ol>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the final blog in our three-part series on leadership in the face of 21st-century challenges. You can read parts <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/the-21st-century-challenges-leaders-face-part-1/">one</a> and <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/we-need-a-new-global-vision-part-2-of-3/">two</a> here. In this blog, I discuss some of the qualities and behaviors emerging as essential elements to better equip leaders to contribute to solutions on a global scale. I see this as a work in progress and my intention is to stimulate thinking and encourage debate.

We need a new definition of what good looks like across a whole range of issues, so we can create a compelling vision for the world we want to live in and the lives we want to lead. We will need to construct new guidelines and principles for our expectations of leaders in society. We will also need to review and refine, even redefine, and place significantly more emphasis on being guided by a more accurate moral and ethical compass founded on solid principles and values. We will need to develop new methods that can be used to test the validity of how we define problems and introduce new methods for their analysis and more rigorously simulate and test the effectiveness of proposed solutions. We also need to redefine what it means to be a citizen of the world so that it’s not just our leaders we hold accountable to new standards but ourselves too.

<strong>Recognizing and Spearheading Change</strong>

My reflections lead me to consider the following as not only desirable but required leadership qualities. Some of these are not new, but emphasis may necessarily be amplified, and of course, as we explore them together, I expect there will be more to add. For now, I suggest the following for 21st-century leaders:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Be purpose driven. </b>To lead in the 21st century, we need leaders who act with positive intention in the service of the greater good and who see it as their responsibility to orchestrate cohesive and comprehensive initiatives that drive change for good.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Possess higher-level consciousness.</b> This may be the most important quality for leaders to develop. 21st-century leaders’ consciousness will need to evolve beyond being impulsive and defensive to unitive. In other words, from separated to integrated and from individual to collective. The work of Susanne Cook Greuter and Robert Kegan shines a light on this and points the way: when consciousness at a higher level is considered, the bar for the qualities our world leaders need to possess is raised significantly. Qualities we should be able to observe in our leaders include: 1) the capability to hold multiple perspectives simultaneously, 2) the skills to navigate paradox beyond simple polarities and cut through complexity, and 3) the ability to understand the multiple systems at play and recognize their interdependency.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">We will need leaders who can <b>think systemically</b> and appreciate the essential interconnectedness of all phenomena and be <b>construct aware, </b>recognizing the constructed aspects of all perceptual positions and boundaries, objects, self-identity, and the stories we tell ourselves about life and nature.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Be visionary, compelling, and persuasive.</b> To win both hearts and minds of their followers, especially if their agenda is full of challenge and change, leaders more than ever will need to convince a wide range of audiences to trust them and inspire their engagement.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">We will need leaders who are willing to <b>be courageous</b> and have much-needed conversations about extremely sensitive and complex topics. Challenging conventional thinking; raising topics that are uncomfortable, controversial, and tricky to navigate; and leaning into them voluntarily and early will take courage.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Those who lead the most impactful organizations and institutions that shape our world will need to <b>make a step change in how they frame and analyze the critical dilemmas</b> that must be addressed if our society is to change for the better and learn lessons from the past.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Be inclusive.</b> Listening to all stakeholders and understanding others’ experiences, perspectives, hopes, fears, and ideas will help ensure leaders are informed by diverse opinions and a richer, more eclectic range of information sources. In the process they will have built their standing with a wide range of stakeholder communities. Being skilled in creating inclusive cultures, where everyone feels valued and has a true sense of belonging, will be critical. Creating psychological safety will be a prerequisite.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Be humble. </b>We will need leaders to have the maturity to recognize that they cannot expect to be in possession of all the knowledge and have all the answers alone. To get to better answers, they need to be both motivated and able to harness the wisdom of the collective.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">We will have to face difficult and challenging questions and dig in deeply to <b>find better-informed and enlightened insight</b> if we truly want to be better placed to develop more effective and sustainable solutions. We must have a <b>willingness to collaborate,</b> bring groups together, leverage peer groups and business forums, and sponsor think tanks and cross-industry initiatives—even with those seen as competitors.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Be a sponsor</b> that embraces and positively harnesses human ingenuity,<b>innovation, and creativity.</b> For sustainable change for the better, new ways of working collectively will need to be successfully brought to life.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Be tech savvy. </b>Without question, fantastic advances in technology continue to accelerate possibilities that hitherto seemed far-fetched, and this will mean exciting applications can be developed that are enablers to change for the better how we live, work, and interact.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Consider the long term.</b> Have longer-term horizons to truly understand the consequences of the important decisions made and changes driven, as we need them to have lasting, positive impact. Balancing the short with longer term has always been a presenting challenge for leaders—going forward an emphasis on stewardship will be required.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Value multidisciplinary and multilateral approaches to driving change.</b> We will also need to understand the importance of blending expertise from multiple fields to address multidimensional problems. Being able to recruit expertise from constituents in the wide range of interconnected systems that sit inside and outside their organizations will be key.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Be authentic and transparent.</b> These qualities will be needed as leaders contend with additional stakeholders to satisfy, increased regulatory requirements for transparent reporting, and stakeholder scrutiny. The environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) agenda is here to stay and is already driving the need for transparency and a requirement to operate with highest levels of integrity to satisfy a wider stakeholder community. Green washing or running corporate social responsibility (CSR) as an adjunct to the core business will no longer be enough or be tolerated.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Be a proactive influencer. </b>Leaders have an opportunity and the potential for having the most positive impact on a wide range of environmental, social, and economic issues. They will need to participate in the development of new programs so they can shape and influence international and regional government policy and regulatory affairs. Business has an opportunity to help policy makers get the balance right to create incentive for business to act in ways that go far beyond mere compliance.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>And finally, be resilient.</b> Leading has always been a huge, energetically demanding role. It comes with privilege and power and some might say onerous responsibility. Understanding and embedding routines and disciplines that ensure physical, emotional, and mental health is critical to ensuring leaders are fully resourced to show up at their best.</li>
</ul>
“We shape leaders, and leaders shape the world. At RHR, we believe leadership is a noble endeavor. Done well, it is a force for good in the world. We exist to unlock the potential in all leaders.”

This is our <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/about-us/">mission statement as a company</a>, and it motivates and inspires me. In sharing these thoughts and reflections, I hope that with your help we can continue to refine thinking to help and support leaders to be what the world now needs them to be. I welcome your thoughts and feedback and look forward to developing a constructive and informative dialogue with the intention of creating a platform for a debate and sharing a well-informed and co-created point of view.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When I was first hired as a consultant at RHR international in 1985, Bob Shaffer was the regional manager. The license plate on his car read, GROW. Bob was 65 years old.

Bob viewed himself and everyone else (in the most positive way) as continuous measurable improvement projects. Times and circumstances change, and new challenges arise, calling for behaviors that sometimes are new, unpracticed, rusty, or embedded in an earlier age. Bob never let his consultants or his client executives off the hook and never gave them license to view themselves or their direct reports as finished products. In fact, one of my colleagues recalls the time he met with Bob in a restaurant. They were so engrossed in their development conversation that neither noticed a robbery going on at the front of the place until a policeman came to their table and asked them what they had witnessed.

In my <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/why-leaders-avoid-giving-feedback/">last post</a>, I talked about the importance of feedback and why leaders avoid it. Here are a few thoughts on making feedback a regular part of the conversation rather than something you wait to give only during a performance review. Giving feedback regularly can <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">help your executives grow purposefully</a>, stay ahead of the game, and lead more effectively instead of evolving slowly or growing stale. It will also put you in the top decile of development-minded executives and likely aid in retention.
<ol>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Prepare the soil: </b>I work with an energy executive who puts it this way: “One of the very first things I do with new direct reports is tell them I will provide direct and real-time feedback because I care about their growth and development. It’s a form of recognition.”</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Make it collaborative: </b>Frame it up as a mutual conversation versus straight feedback. Engage them: “How did you think that meeting went? Where did you feel most effective? Where might you have taken a different approach to get the best outcome?”</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Be situation specific:</b> Imbed feedback in a specific context. Identify how a strength in one situation may be a weakness in another situation. Have a conversation about the dangers of playing only to one’s strengths. Provide a vivid example of where you overcame that tendency yourself: “My natural inclination as a leader is to take control. While doing so is sometimes essential, I’ve had to learn to grab the wheel only in truly urgent situations and otherwise solicit full participation from my team.”</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Feed forward: </b>Add a future-looking component: “What might you do differently next time to increase your impact?”</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Capture teachable moments: </b>Whenever possible, deliver feedback in real time, when the behavior in question is fresh and top of mind. Never wait until end of year.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Put it in career context:</b> Be clear regarding implications for their career progression: “Broadening your repertoire in these kinds of situations will build a case for your taking on greater responsibilities.”</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Avoid the “feedback sandwich”:</b> Balance positive with corrective feedback but beware of the critical piece getting buried between two pats on the back. Then check for understanding to make sure all the points landed.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/thought-leadership/blog/blow-your-development-plan">Take action for immediate relevance</a>: Help them jump-start the new behavior by putting it into action this week or better yet, this afternoon.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1"><a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/good-luck-with-those-development-plans/">Remember that you treasure what you measure</a>: Create feedback loops (360s, post-meeting reviews) to reinforce the new behaviors and provide tangible evidence of progress.</li>
</ol>
Getting comfortable with feedback conversations isn’t just a skill to be used in the workplace. In their book Fair Talk, S. Gorbatov and A. Lane suggest, “...it will not only make you a better leader but a better partner, sibling, child, parent, and friend.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As you may have already seen in my <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/the-21st-century-challenges-leaders-face-part-1/">recent blog</a>, leaders around the world are facing a long list of pressing global issues. We may have a view of what we want to be different and what we want to move away from, but to harness our energy, we will need to build a powerful and compelling shared vision for what’s next. This means now more than ever, it is time for us to craft a new vision for the world we want to build. To illustrate this, here are some of the broader societal questions that come to mind.
<h3>What will be our generation's legacy? What do we want it to be?</h3>
Turning our attention to the next 20 to 50 years, we need to make an honest appraisal of what our legacy will be should we not make some significant changes. It will also enable us to paint a clear picture of what we want to move away from and avoid. Away-from motivation though is not enough. We know this just by looking at how unsuccessful doom mongering has been at generating mass positive action. We need to do more. Envisioning what the world could look like if we do change will help us paint a positive vision of the future, which collectively would inspire us to engage and commit to actively work together to deliver it. This will help address our ability to motivate and mobilize others to drive change. Having something compelling to move toward gives us purpose, real meaning, and a sense of direction. Toward and away-from motivation in combination will be much more powerful in generating the motivation needed to change.

We should acknowledge the progress humanity has achieved. The world in some respects is the safest it has ever been; there are fewer people dying of poverty, disease, and war than ever in our history. In raising this, it is not my intention to whitewash or greenwash the current dilemmas we face but to encourage us all to build on the innovations of the past and work to accelerate and scale our responses together to address our most pressing problems.

For our legacy to be one of which we can be proud, there are pressing challenges leaders must invest more collective energy in and immerse themselves fully in to gain a much deeper and richer understanding. These include:
<h3>Do we want to continue to widen the gap between the haves and the have nots?</h3>
The growth in the disparity between those who own and have control over assets and those who do not has continued to widen. The systems of wealth creation perpetuate this divisive dynamic, which in turn leads to building levels of resentment and disenfranchisement in those who fall into the have-not category. The social unrest we are witnessing is not only motivated by racism, it is also in part a reaction to the growing sense of injustice, unfairness, and helplessness that a growing number of our communities are feeling regardless of race or creed. Leaders need to urgently look at our relentless pursuit of globalization and question the principles on which wealth is distributed. What will be the new ways of creating wealth and upward mobility? Economic models of the past will not sustain us in the future. We will need to embrace new economic and social models if we want to provide access for all to a living wage, healthcare, and education. No business can really thrive long term in a dysfunctional societal system.
<h3>Are we doing all we can to save our planet?</h3>
The science on this topic has gained traction, and the evidence that humankind is likely continuing to do irreversible damage to our planet is becoming more widely accepted. Our use of ecologically and environmentally hostile materials and unsustainable, irreplaceable, and nonrecyclable resources continues despite clear scientific evidence and some efforts by policy makers to reduce levels. The destruction of our natural environment, the degradation of our atmosphere, and the pollution of our oceans continues unabated. The consequences of not taking effective collective and swift action now will be catastrophic and far-reaching. All businesses are reliant on this delicately balanced, complex support system.
<h3>Should we place more emphasis on building resilient and caring communities?</h3>
There is (as I have hopefully in a balanced way said repeatedly) cause for hope and optimism, because fundamentally human beings are social animals, and as we have seen through this pandemic, we are capable of selflessness and compassion. However, in most societies we are witnessing how many suffer with poor access to healthcare and the lack of effective safety nets for those less economically privileged. Our methods and systems of farming, food production and distribution, secure supplies, safe clean water, and clean energy have all been exposed for their systemic weaknesses. These systems are fundamental to all organizations, and if they don’t function well, businesses will not have access to and be able to trade with healthy customers and get the work done with healthy employees.
<h3>Going forward, what role should governments and institutions play?</h3>
We have seen through the experience of the pandemic a wide range of responses from national governments. Some have been judged as more effective than others. What we learn as we emerge to the other side should provide a sharp wake-up call for us all. Political leaders have been exposed in many cases as ill-equipped both as leaders and in terms of the institutions of government on which they depend, along with the instruments of government and range of interventions available to them, to respond effectively and be trusted by their electorate. Many of our governments and associated institutions, with a few notable exceptions such as the United Nations, have been set up to serve and protect national interests, which may have been appropriate in the past. However, the challenges we face today require collective multinational, multilateral cooperation. It may well be time to take a cold, hard look at the systems and structure of governments from a more elevated perspective to see how they will need to change and adapt to be fit for purpose given the nature of the 21st-century challenges we face.

Business leaders have long accepted the need for continual change, restructuring, reskilling, and realigning their organizations to meet the changing demands of the customers and markets they serve. Their skills and experience when shared could help accelerate the pace and effectiveness of our collective efforts. A hypothesis worthy of further exploration is that when regional national and local governments, institutions, and large-scale commercial organizations come together, their chances of developing more coherent, cohesive, and effective solutions increase exponentially. We already have data on the positive impact groups have when they are diverse and inclusive in their composition and share a clear higher purpose and intention to do meaningful work. The performance of commercial organizations with more diverse boards, for example, presents solid evidence that validates this perspective.

This second blog in the series hopefully sets out the context in which 21st-century leaders are operating and takes a broad look at some of the most critical challenges we all face. In the next blog in the series, we explore the qualities that leaders will need to navigate successfully—<a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-assessment/">The Winning Formula® profile</a> for the 21st-century leader.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At RHR, we spend a lot of time working pre and post deal with PE firms and their portfolio companies. A critical factor in accelerating value creation is strong, enduring alignment between the PE board and portfolio CEO. We increasingly hear about the elements of surprise from both deal partners and CEOs in the first year of ownership as the board/management-team relationship unfolds.

For example, a deal partner we often support describes how a founder CEO simply doesn't get it. “I’m surprised. I thought we were aligned on the value-creation plan, but he just can’t seem to prioritize. There’s always one more shiny thing to chase, and that can cause a lot of organizational swirl. We have to keep reining him in, and it can be exhausting.”

On the other side of the partnership, a CEO describes her experience: “I’m not used to being so managed and the board being so involved in the details of the business. I’m surprised they want to get so deeply into the minutiae of the numbers. It creates so much work for us. We just want to get on with managing the business.”

This is especially the case at the lower-middle market space when PE firms invest in founder-entrepreneur-run businesses. Part of the rub is that founder-entrepreneurs are truly working with a proper board for the first time. Many are not used to the level of oversight they encounter. In addition, they are being asked to lead and manage in a very different way than the one that has been key to their success to date. There is a steep learning curve associated with the shift from founder-entrepreneur to a more professionalized CEO of a PE-backed business.

Tensions like these are predictable and have much to do with setting clear expectations at the front end of the relationship. It seems quite obvious that having a conversation about ways of working would be second nature. It is less obvious to have a deeper conversation about personality styles—similarities and differences that if understood could forge a more complementary board/management-team relationship.

Generally, time spent with one another learning differences in thinking and working styles will eventually unveil similarities and contrasts that have to be understood and worked through. The process of learning can be fraught at times. We have witnessed the inherent challenges on both sides of the equation.

We also noticed some striking personality differences that are in play in many instances. We looked at the Hogan personality profiles of 39 CEO founder-entrepreneurs and 45 deal partners across 40 different organizations. The Hogan includes a number of different personality assessments: the Hogan Personality Inventory (HPI) describes how we relate to others when we are at our best; the Hogan Development Survey (HDS) describes qualities that emerge in times of stress that can derail people’s chances of success; and the Hogan Motives, Values, Preferences Inventory (MVPI) describes the core goals, values, drivers, and interests that determine what we desire and strive to attain.
<h3><strong>Drivers and Motivators</strong></h3>
&nbsp;

Both groups are driven to succeed and highly motivated to make money, and they have a high desire for control and to be in a position of authority. In general, they are ambitious, assertive, and clear minded about goals.

If these energies are aligned and focused on the same set of goals, it is easier to get traction earlier. The challenge comes when somewhat hardheaded and confident people are misaligned (cue the sound of butting heads).

Noticeable differences exist between the two groups in their respective risk appetites. On average, CEO founder-entrepreneurs are spontaneous, flexible, and willing to take risks. Deal partners prefer more predictability, order, and structure—they want to reduce and control risk. CEO founder-entrepreneurs are not afraid to try new things and break the mold. They tend to be more agile and more comfortable with ambiguity.

Again, if these differences are appreciated, diverse perspectives can lead to better outcomes—founder-entrepreneurs push boundaries and deal partners reel them in to land in a place of positive compromise. If the contrasts are not understood, and worse, personalized, it’s easy to get stuck with, “He is so impractical and risky,” or “They are so pedestrian and risk averse that they are missing the big-picture upside.”
<h3><strong>Leading and Working Styles (HPI)</strong></h3>
&nbsp;

Both deal partners and CEO-founder-entrepreneurs are highly action oriented, but generally, CEOs want to move faster and are less likely to ask for input and guidance before making a call. They are used to making quick decisions in order to capture opportunities and would rather be wrong and fail fast than overcomplicate issues. CEOs are generally comfortable in the gray areas, asking questions to think through new ideas and insights, whereas deal partners tend to be less contemplative and more practical and to value results over abstraction. Again, the tension between dreaming big, pushing the boundaries of what is possible, and moving quickly to capture opportunities (the founder-entrepreneur mindset) and a more pragmatic, predictable approach that involves structure and focus (the deal-partner mindset) could make for a highly complementary partnership. However, without a full appreciation of these differences, they can be regular sources of tension and frustration.
<h3><strong>Overused Strengths and Derailers (HDS)</strong></h3>
&nbsp;

Under pressure and stress, deal partners and CEO-founder-entrepreneurs show some important differences in their leadership styles. At their best, CEOs can be experienced as charming, creative, and outgoing. At their worst, they can be seen as impractical, limit testing, and impulsive. Left unchecked, they risk launching too many initiatives without adequate follow-up to ensure execution or losing focus on what is important. In moments of stress, they tend to default to their own sense of confidence and risk undercommunicating to their stakeholders.

At their best, deal partners are experienced as having a critical eye and being more keyed into the knock-on effects of certain organizational decisions. They can serve as the side and rearview mirrors for a CEO. Under pressure, these traits can become amplified and then be experienced as cynical and distrusting. Combined with a tendency to control risk and dig into the details when results are not forthcoming, tensions can appear, given each group deals with stress in very different ways. CEOs want to run faster, paint a positive picture, and figure it out themselves. Deal partners want to be more involved and get into the detail and will demand a realistic business picture.

These insights represent themes we see reflected across Hogan profiles. Individuals are higher and lower across the scales we examined and do not all fit nicely into the same box. For example, some founder CEOs are as risk averse as deal partners. Some deal partners can be impulsive decision makers. Taken as a group though, there are enough differences to reassert the need to dig into personality profiles to accelerate alignment.
<h3><strong>A Simple Approach to Unearthing Personality Differences</strong></h3>
&nbsp;

Some of our private equity partners have bought into the notion that a) the Hogan assessments provide valid insights into leadership styles, b) understanding style differences between CEOs and deal partners is a useful exercise, c) having an alignment conversation and developing a plan to manage these differences help build a strong and trusting relationship faster, and d) interpersonal understanding reduces unhealthy conflict.

We use a simple approach of having both the CEO and deal partner(s) complete the Hogan assessments. On some occasions, profiles of other members of the management team are included. The test takes about an hour to complete. Once deal partners have completed their tests, those results can be reused in future comparisons. RHR’s Hogan Center of Excellence conducts a deep data comparison to identify points of similarity and difference and implications for the working relationship. We then facilitate an alignment conversation to work through the insights, develop a plan to manage differences, and ensure diverse ways of thinking and operating are complementary. Interpersonal understanding helps proactively identify rub points and maximize the benefits of difference.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[asdfsadfsadf Imagine this: it’s time for your quarterly performance review. You’ve carved precious time out of your calendar to meet with your manager, gathered any questions you might have, and downed a gallon of coffee the day of. But after weeks of anticipation and mental preparation, all you’re told is:

<i>“You’re doing a great job—keep it up!”</i>

You’d hoped for <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">actionable feedback</a>, not a well-intended compliment. What gives?

Many of our most important learnings and career tipping points have come from meaningful feedback. Yet we are often uncomfortable with delivering feedback despite its importance. We hesitate, procrastinate until the annual review, or simply avoid it altogether. And curiously, the closer one is to the C-suite, the less feedback one receives.

I’ve heard countless senior executives share the same story: “It’s been years since I’ve gotten direct feedback or had a performance review from my boss.” However, <b>receiving feedback in the latter half of one’s career is just as important as it is in the beginning.</b> In fact, it can be argued that it is even more crucial to receive feedback later down the line, given the level of impact senior executives have on their organizations.

So why the feedback avoidance?
<h3><strong>Relationship Slippage</strong></h3>
One reason, as stated in the book Fair Talk by Sergey Gorbatov and Angela Lane, is that “Consciously or subconsciously, feedback is perceived as a threat, something we as social beings try to avoid; the risk of harming the relationship looms larger than the risks to the recipient’s performance and career.”
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>Well-placed feedback is a gift—one that seldom puts a solid relationship in jeopardy.</b> By providing feedback, we facilitate our direct reports’ ability to <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/">meet their career objectives</a> and to realize their own personal visions. By withholding feedback, we compromise their ability to meet the requirements of their role and deliver stellar results that secure their jobs.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Pursuit of Perfection</strong></h3>
In our desire to be fair, accurate, and helpful, we worry so much about the content of the message that we wordsmith it to death.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Instead, remember that the <b>delivery and the nonverbals often have a greater impact than the actual content of our message. </b>You have the person’s best interests at heart and are authentically aligned with their ambitions; this almost always comes across when presented with a positive mindset.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Fear of Bringing Them Down</strong></h3>
We inherently desire to build people up. It’s easy to think that glowing feedback (“you’re great; don’t change a thing”) will raise their confidence and boost their performance. Perhaps they’re a superstar, and we fear that giving them constructive feedback will discourage and push them to seek roles elsewhere.
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">However, if they’re truly a superstar, they <b>won’t appreciate softball messages and may seek out a new leader</b> to provide them with direct feedback—perhaps in a new company altogether.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Old Dog, New Tricks</strong></h3>
“The executives are set in their ways, so why waste the effort?” Or, “I’m not willing to change, so I won’t ask them to.” Sound familiar?
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>The truth of the matter is no one is too old to grow. </b>Feedback, even if delivered with positive intent, may not always be well received. However, emotionally mature executives will reflect on and benefit from constructive feedback every time. Those who are too narcissistic or set in their ways to internalize feedback should probably be counseled out of the organization.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Financial Results are All The Feedback They Need</strong></h3>
So, why go beyond that and conduct an extended review?
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1"><b>This takes a pretty narrow view of leadership. </b>An executive can achieve superior financial results in the short term while simultaneously engaging in behaviors that contribute to the organization’s downfall. Leadership behaviors live on in the organization for years to come. <b>How the job gets done </b>makes the real difference in building sustained business success over time.</li>
</ul>
Feedback is central to growth and purposeful development. Becoming more comfortable with giving feedback necessitates a shift in mindset from fear of doing harm to “I’m in your corner and want to give you something that is truly valuable.” <b>Be unapologetic about your pursuit and delivery of quality feedback</b>—after all, to know is to grow.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“We shape leaders, and leaders shape the world. At RHR, we believe leadership is a noble endeavor. Done well, it is a force for good in the world. We exist to unlock the potential in all leaders.”

This is our <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/about-us/">mission statement</a> as a company, and it’s a motivational and inspirational one for me personally. However, as I reflect on current world events and the range of challenges we face, the evidence seems to suggest we still have a long way to go to achieve our vision: a world where well-led companies generate a positive, lasting impact on employees, shareholders, and communities. Of course, leaders of companies are not solely responsible for the current state of world affairs, but they are significant constituents and may use their positions to show the way and develop a benchmark for leaders in other walks of life. In fact, as I hope to convey later, in some ways leaders of companies may be less constrained than they may at first think to rescope their roles and ways of operating to become the leading forces for good. There are strong signals that the nature and composition of stakeholders and their expectations are shifting, and this creates a strong demand for change. These are challenging times (perhaps now more than ever), and in light of this we should be researching and crafting a new The Winning Formula® profile for leadership in the 21st century.
<h3><strong>A Changing, Shifting World</strong></h3>
The essential question I want to pose is: <b>What kind of leaders can successfully address 21st century challenges?</b> My intention in writing this blog series is to provoke and motivate all leaders in all walks of life to consider their roles in 1) catalyzing productive discussion and debate, 2) deriving clearer, more valuable insight, and 3) encouraging and motivating appropriate action. However, before we lean into that question, I thought it useful to first step back and consider the changing context of our shifting world today.
<h3><strong>A Perfect Storm - Accelerating The Future To Now </strong></h3>
2020 events, including notably the COVID-19 pandemic and the tragic death of George Floyd, have brought into sharp focus the need for change. How do we collectively overcome global threats such as this pandemic, which in this case is a serious threat to human life? And how do we eradicate racism? It’s not as if before now there weren’t many easily identifiable areas for improvement. However, increased social unrest, the real prospect of a prolonged and severe economic downturn with the hardships it will cause, and the continued, tragic deaths caused by the pandemic, have all conspired to create a perfect storm. This moment in time has the potential to be pivotal. During 2020 in business, we saw winners and losers. We saw how those who could pivot and adapt quickly or by virtue of their business model or chosen sector could thrive, while those less well-placed unfortunately did not or are unlikely to survive. In 2021, more of us appear to be waking up to the real need for change and the opportunity this represents. This awakening calls for us all to raise our consciousness and our game both as leaders and as citizens of the world. The global challenges facing humankind have been headline news for some time. The ability of governments and institutions to address local and national concerns and at the same time come together effectively to address global issues has legitimately come to be critically questioned. New, more effectively adapted forms of leadership and collaboration are needed.
<h3><strong>The Issues Leaders Face</strong></h3>
The list of global issues that need effective international cooperation of governments, institutions, and leaders across all industry sectors has been growing and is becoming more pressing. The challenges are many and look daunting. But the prize for us all if we lean into these challenges positively—as opportunities—is not only to reduce pain and suffering but also to shape and create a world and a society of which we can be proud, and that to me is priceless.

As leaders, we must more effectively lead and engage our communities to develop effective strategies and tactics to address critical issues proactively. Being passive is not an option—the survival of mankind and the planet on which we live is at stake. We must address these issues as a matter of urgency:
<ul>
 	<li aria-level="1">Dismantling all forms of discrimination</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Determining the value and assessing the real impact of globalization and what should come next</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Bringing an end to military and terrorist conflict</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">The future of consumerism</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">The effectiveness of both autocratic and democratic systems of government and how they should evolve</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">The reduction of carbon emissions and general pollution; ceasing the destruction of ecosystems; and developing more sustainable farming, food production, water, energy, and waste management systems.</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">How to prepare for significant changes in the demographics of the world’s population</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">The fairness, stability, and effectiveness of our financial systems and the eradication of poverty and starvation</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">The provision of accessible healthcare for all</li>
 	<li aria-level="1">Education that is fit for purpose and helps prepare future generations</li>
</ul>
All of us can be a part of the solution, whether as leaders of large-scale organizations or smaller businesses and as citizens. We all have a part to play.

The UN presents and groups its thinking into 17 distinct, global challenges—the first 16 align with the list above. However, perhaps the most telling in terms of successfully addressing those challenges is the last on the list: Partnerships. I interpret this as a strong signal that a new age of multilateral, multidisciplinary collaboration is being called for.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-1555 size-medium" src="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/image1-300x186.png" alt="" width="300" height="186" />
<h3><strong>Causes For Optimism</strong></h3>
There are, though, causes for optimism as humans are inherently ingenious, creative, and innovative. We can and should draw confidence from recognizing some impressive measures of progress already made. For example, according to the UN, there has been progress on the world’s poverty reduction target, one of its sustainable development goals (SDG). Research teams from the World Bank, ODI, the IHME, and Brookings, jointly with the World Data Lab, made independent projections for what we can expect for global poverty during the SDG era. While the projections differ in methodology and underlying assumptions, it’s striking how much they align to their projections for what to expect in the coming decade if the world stays on current trajectories. All expect some positive development—the number of people in extreme poverty is expected to continue to decline—but all also agree there is no room for complacency as the world is not on track to end extreme poverty by 2030. Measurement of progress is still problematic and challenging, but progress is being made on both sourcing more accurate data and determining the metrics that really matter.

Another example to encourage our optimism has been the recent outstanding and effective collaboration at a global level of scientists in developing, at an extraordinary pace, a range of vaccines that gives us a real opportunity to immunize the world against COVID-19. There are definitely some learnings here on how effectively we can collaborate when we unite in the service of a great cause. We have a variety of vaccines and a science community collaborating to stay ahead of the virus as it mutates and new variants emerge. However, global distribution and ensuring timely and affordable access to the vaccine in developing countries highlights that there are still many structural, political, economic, and social inequalities and barriers to equality. There are causes for optimism too—science, technology, and our ability to unlock potential through human ingenuity, creativity, and innovation.

For business leaders, there is growing recognition that besides the global challenges captured by the UN’s sustainable development goals, there are even more underlying and fast-emerging trends to which CEOs, particularly of global organizations, must start to pay attention. However, making useful meaning of the potential impact of these trends requires new approaches to information gathering and analysis. In his provocative book 2030: How Today’s Biggest Trends Will Collide and Reshape the Future of Everything, Mauro Guillén, professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and former director of the Lauder Institute of Management &amp; International Studies, identifies a range of demographic, economic, and technology shifts he encourages us to consider. He suggests the dynamic interplay between a range of forces will converge and dramatically change the landscape in which businesses operate. Leaders, he suggests, will need to adopt less linear and compartmentalized approaches to determining their strategies, and they will need to embrace more lateral thinking and be prepared to integrate unconventional points of view to both understand the potential impacts on their businesses and be better placed to respond to them. New sustainable, regenerative, and adaptive business models will be needed to ensure these organizations can meet the changing expectations and needs of their consumers and wider stakeholder communities. We can see this in the movement toward organizations being held to account and having to make public not only their intentions on the environmental, social, and governance agendas but also their progress and to be subject to scrutiny.

In the commercial world, the exclusive pursuit of growth and profitability alone will not suffice. Even before COVID-19, there was a growing sense that shareholder value should not be the only measure of corporate value. In August 2019, more than 181 U.S. CEOs signed a statement committing themselves to other priorities, for example, investing in employees, supporting communities, and dealing ethically with suppliers. The idea of the triple bottom line—<b>profit, people, and planet</b>—has become mainstream as has socially responsible investment funds. As we emerge from the crisis, the next generations of consumers will, no doubt, be more vigilant than before in selecting brands that live up to this new set of challenging values. What your brand stands for and whether it passes the consumer tests will matter more than ever before.

Judy Samuelson, in her new book, The Six New Rules of Business: Creating Real Value in a Changing World, also explores how societal shifts in recent decades have upended the traditional rules of business, calling into question the business’s purpose and its role in society and offering new rules for how to make businesses successful in their new social contexts. Of primary relevance to us all is the point she makes about the health of the systems on which businesses depend now becoming a central and strategic responsibility and a duty of care for the leaders. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) and environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) can no longer be adjuncts to the business agenda, they need to be central and integrated into the core. Capital, she suggests, is no longer a scarce resource, but talent, skilled labor, innovation, and creativity are. Samuelson argues that intangibles, such as trust and reputation—not cash and hard assets—drive value (up to 80–85%).

Essentially, the conclusion is that the world is changing fast. In some cases, the global issues and challenges are very clear—we know what we need to achieve, and we still have work to do on how to collectively get there. Despite some laudable efforts and progress, we are not getting there fast enough. In other cases, unless we shift our mindset and perspectives, we may not put ourselves in a position to see what is coming and be prepared to adapt and respond.

In my next blog, I will discuss questions leaders may now additionally need to answer to establish a clearer, more compelling vision of the future to help us galvanize.]]></content:encoded>

We have learned much from our clients about how to lead during this turbulent time and have been impressed by the agility of our clients and their teams as most turned around their business performances. But even more so, we have been struck by their thoughtfulness in the face of such adversity. They aspire to have an impact not only on their businesses but also on those powerful forces shaping us all. What follows is our fourth installment of themes that emerged from these intimate sessions.

&nbsp;

Since there is no right answer to many of the challenges CEOs face as they navigate these choppy waters, we present the themes as “tensions to balance” more than as prescriptions for success.

&nbsp;

<b>TENSION 1: TURNING AROUND THE BUSINESS WHILE SCENARIO PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE</b>

&nbsp;

Remarkably, most of our CEO clients have stabilized their business performance. They made hard decisions early in the pandemic cycle and got costs under control while finding creative ways to support critical employees and infrastructure. They continue to scenario plan for the future, with uncertain lines of sight into anything more than six months out. Most continue to look for ways to shift their business models as they anticipate some long-lasting structural changes on the demand side for their products and services. Two thirds of these CEOs were perplexed by their stock performance, even though they performed well in this quarter and showed promising signs for growth in the medium term, demonstrating the considerable amount of ambiguity from investors and analysts in predicting the future.

<b>TENSION 2: TAKING CARE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES AND CULTURE WHILE RE-ENVISIONING “BACK TO WORK”</b>

<a href="https://www.rhrinternational.com/sites/default/files/pdf_files/Leadership-in-Times-of-Uncertainty.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Caring for employees</a> was top of mind for CEOs this quarter. Some worried out loud about the mental health of their workforce. From frontline workers to those working from home, the stress and strain of the pandemic has brought increased wear and tear and instability to their employees. These CEOs and their teams were finding creative ways to engage and sustain their employees, from short-term incentives to benefits targeted to mental health support.

All CEOs shared ways in which they and their teams were engaging with employees and monitoring their engagement. Several noted surprise at how the CEO demonstrating humility, curiosity, and authenticity  seemed to move the needle most on engagement. One of our clients commented that he spends much of his time as “chief communications officer,” noting that EQ is far more important than IQ right now. These behaviors, backed by real action from CEOs around diversity, inclusion, and belonging and flexible back-to-work options, had the most impact on engagement scores. On both the <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">D,I&amp;B</a> front and back-to-work, CEOs discussed tactical plans from whether or not to publicly share D,I&amp;B commitments stemming from George Floyd and the BLM movement to mandating vaccines for employees upon their return to the office. Most are publicly sharing D,I&amp;B metrics (even given the risks of underperforming) and are not mandating vaccines as a prerequisite to return to the office (although several are finding ways to incent vaccinations).

In the end, CEOs agree that there is no going back to the way things were and that some blend of in-person and virtual work will be here to stay.

<b>TENSION 3: LEADING THE BUSINESS WHILE HAVING A GREATER IMPACT </b>

As dealing with the pandemic itself has become the new normal for CEOs, they are lifting their heads up and thinking about how to address the powerful forces shaping business and society. CEOs who have strong leadership teams are delegating more of the day-to-day running of the business as they deal with the first and second tensions discussed above.

There is growing momentum from CEOs and business leaders to simultaneously rise above tribalism or the crisis of the moment and begin to lead from the front on issues of racism, climate impact and sustainable business, the impact of converging technologies on employment, and new economic and business models. As the recent Edelman Trust Survey highlighted, CEOs are now one of the most trusted leadership categories globally given their focus on facts and science and the growing momentum toward bringing ESG to life in their organizations. Our CEO clients saw the greatest challenge to having greater impact on these issues as their own lack of collective action—and realized that if they did not find a way to lead, the void would be filled by the blunt instrument of increased regulation.

Boardroom and C-suite executives face a truly unique landscape of challenges and requirements, especially at a time like this. At RHR, we partner to support and enhance board and CEO performance during times of smooth sailing and turbulence. We challenge the assumptions, beliefs, and behaviors that constrain performance, but we do so in a way that our clients can hear—with empathy as well as candor.

With more than 75 years of experience, we offer world-class coaching for CEO succession and transition, CEO performance management, and board development. <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/get-in-touch/">Reach out to us today</a> to discover how we can empower the vital people at the very top of your organization.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span>asdfsadfsadf“That's the biggest risk a board has—is if you pick the wrong CEO…”</span>

<span>Warren Buffett</span>

<strong>May 3, 2021</strong>

<span>Warren Buffett, legendary CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, knows a thing or two about what does and doesn’t make a business successful. He pulled no punches in May. In addition to sharing some of what Mr. Buffet believes are a firm’s biggest risk factors, let me highlight some thoughts of my own.</span>

<span>A company’s prospectus and annual report typically list any identified risks that can have a material impact on the company and its business, such as economic, legal, financial, environmental, and regulatory dangers, to name a few. A top-notch prospectus will identify the probabilities and may identify plans to compensate for these possibilities. A best-in-class prospectus even identifies succession plans, just as Warren Buffett announced his own succession plan at the most recent annual meeting. However, he also pointed out the biggest risk that is seldom, if ever, addressed in the prospectus or annual report. I will start with his and add some other red flags.</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Warren Buffett’s biggest risk factor: The nice person—well-liked and doing their best but inadequate for the task of running the company. The individual’s values and personality are decent and grounded, but their behavioral capabilities may be in short supply. In such cases, the board of directors may give the individual too much of a pass, particularly if it avoids conflict.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>The CEO who does all of the talking. This is the CEO whose listening skills are absent or in short supply. They send far more information than they are willing to receive.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>The CEO who asks for input but employs it infrequently. The not-invented-here attitude rejects others’ ideas, even inside the company. It is not very motivating for the executive team.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>CEOs who are reluctant to borrow good ideas from competitors or other industries that could be applied inside their own company. Such CEOs do not scan broadly enough for fresh perspectives, business threats, or novel approaches.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Risk-averse CEOs. These CEOs are too conservative and only try things that are guaranteed to succeed. Risks should always be evaluated, but if certitude is required on all decisions, moving forward will not grow a company or build a strong strategy. This can be seen occasionally in the year or two before a CEO retires because they want to protect their legacy.</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>CEOs that feel they must have all the answers because they are the CEO. This is the psychological burden of self-expectation that the CEO should know everything there is to know. It is a psychological constraint that limits a person’s ability to learn from others.</span></li>
</ul>
<span>A fundamental element to avoid many of these risks is to have a <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-founder/">board</a> that not only understands the business and key players in the company but also, even more importantly, has strong engagement with and meaningful insights into the mind and character of the CEO. Many CEOs will complain about a board that is too intrusive. On the other hand, seldom do CEOs complain about boards that are not sufficiently involved or do not appropriately challenge the CEO’s strategy or direction. So the basic remedies for the board are meaningful involvement, ongoing dialogue, and a results orientation that holds the CEO accountable for delivering on goals.</span>

<i><span>“RHR International has been in the business of CEO fit, CEO succession, executive team effectiveness and board consultation for more than 75 years. I was part of the organization for 20 years. I recommend RHR without reservation.”</span></i>

		<title><![CDATA[Cultivating Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging in the Workplace: Insights from Marvin Rees, Mayor of Bristol]]></title>
		<link>https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/cultivating-diversity-inclusion-and-belonging-in-the-workplace-insights-from-marvin-rees-mayor-of-bristol/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span>We recently had the pleasure of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_JP_7yhEwQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>interviewing Marvin Rees</span></a><span>, a British Labour Party politician who has been the mayor of Bristol since 2016. His approach to his role as mayor can be described as fair, informed, and wise. As the first Black mayor of a major city in the UK, he brings a unique approach to diversity, belonging, and inclusion that can become deeply personal at times.</span>

<span>A real-life example of this is now being covered in the </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000wvzx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>BBC documentary Statue Wars: One Summer in Bristol</span></a><span>, diving into the extraordinary events which followed the toppling of the slave trader Edward Colston’s statue last summer. Colston's memory had divided Bristol for years, with many campaigning successfully for his name to be erased from streets, schools, and venues. However, an ensuing right-wing counterprotest was sparked. </span>

<span>Rees went to the counterprotest in order to talk with those in attendance. He explained that though he agreed with the sentiment behind the statue being toppled, he could not endorse criminal damage. He discovered that the counterprotest attendees felt they were “losing their city.” A conversation ensued in which Rees was able to highlight rising house prices and inaccessible services as being the true cause of cities around the UK being lost. This example of open communication within leadership is one of the many ways that Rees embodies leadership lessons in his role. </span>

<span>We discuss key points from our interview with Mayor Rees below. These lessons are useful for organizations, boards, CEOs, and CHROs around the world that ask themselves: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>How do I build a diverse pipeline of executives that are ready for my most senior roles?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>How do I integrate diverse skills, talents, and capabilities into my culture?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>How do I define behaviors and transform leadership in the business to be more inclusive, globally fluent, innovative, and competitive?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>How do I develop broader and more objective insight on my talent so I understand the strengths and gaps in my business?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>How do I coach my leaders to become true allies and sponsors of my diverse talent in order to accelerate career growth?</span></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;
<h3><strong><a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging</a> in the Corporate World</strong></h3>
<span>In his interview, Rees spoke candidly with RHR International Partner David Langdon, and together they discussed how leading difference is a skill that every modern leader must have. Diverse teams bring new and valuable perspectives to the table. The inability to lead difference can be the undoing of diversity programs and organizations as a whole. As a result, businesses must learn to foster diversity of thought in order to capitalize on the real opportunities within their talent pipelines.</span>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span> </span><span>“Revolutionize your view on talent and stop making assumptions.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span>RHR International Partner David Langdon</span></i></p>

<h3><strong>Advice to Corporate Leaders on <a href="https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-diversity/">Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Policy</a></strong></h3>
<span>Marvin Rees makes the point that business leaders need to be involved in the development and advocacy of policy. While business and local policy may seem unconnected, they are anything but. The talent pipeline comes directly from the towns in which this policy is carried out, meaning that poor quality housing, deteriorating mental health, and a lack of access to critical services all impact a business’s talent pipeline. There is a growing responsibility for leaders to engage in the sustainable and social space. Leaders must think holistically and understand that good-quality policy leads to well-rounded talent.</span>
<h3><strong>Talent Spotting</strong></h3>
<span>Leaders should be held accountable for developing and supporting differences within their organizations, and looking for talent in unexpected places with no assumptions is key. RHR International’s Readiness for ScaleSM assessment model helps organizations holistically assess untapped and often undiscovered talent. We help senior leaders break down barriers and assess all of their talent across the critical areas of the business, enabling them to look at underlying qualities that are much harder to see and quantify. The larger the organization, the greater the risk of being able to mop up the negative and long term consequences of having undiscovered talent. </span>

<span>All too often there is a cultural collusion around what leaders should look like. That creates a narrowed lens. An astonishing example of this is reported in </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-57172634" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>this BBC News story</span></a><span> about a survey conducted by the UK’s Social Mobility Commission, which describes how senior leaders in the UK’s civil service sometimes jump mid-conversation to speaking Latin. If you can play along with this cultural code, then you must be one of us; there’s no threat to the established way. Inclusive? I think not. Elitist, narrow, and protective? I think so.</span><span> </span>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Leadership Qualities</strong></h3>
<span>RHR has identified the following leadership traits of an inclusive leader: </span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Learning Agile: proactively engages in learning; willing to ask questions, be uncomfortable, and create space to be taught; seeks to understand others</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Culturally Fluent: embraces differences and proactively leverages diversity; adjusts approach and style to demonstrate connection and understanding across cultures/difference; looks for opportunities to fully engage in new experiences; considers the subtleties of communication when addressing diverse audiences; creates a culture of belonging and psychological safety</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Leads with Humility: understands and has connected to their own identity; acknowledges mistakes, misspeaking, or lack of knowledge; wields power thoughtfully and considers the impact on others; connects to others through storytelling,</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span>Interpersonal Courage: calls out biases—their own and others; challenges norms/long-held beliefs (operating norms, talent decisions); actively seeks out and dismantles systemic obstacles and barriers that keep people of difference from being successful; is conscious of privilege and creates mechanisms/processes that ensure equal opportunity.  </span></li>
</ul>
<span>Martin Rees breathes fresh air into the dialogue. His leadership, while not purist-corporate, is refreshingly direct. That declarativeness is needed if you want step change. </span>

<span>RHR encourages leaders to steer away from complacency, not to make assumptions, and to inspire them to think differently. Businesses attract and retain the best talent when they truly value each unique individual for what they can deliver. The unit of success is no longer just the individual and the organisation, it is also societal. Leaders who see the whole and can operate at that enterprise level are the ones who will make a difference longer term.</span>
