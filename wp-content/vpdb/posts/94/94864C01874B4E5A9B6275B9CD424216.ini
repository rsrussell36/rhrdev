post_content = "Maja Egnell is a talent-management executive at RHR International. Leveraging her 20 years of industry experience and a multinational worldview, Maja works to fulfill a simple goal: to impact change and help people succeed. Born and raised in Sweden, Maja brings her business-psychology background, leadership-development skills, and global perspective to the table. She specializes in cultivating senior team effectiveness and accelerating the development of executives for clients in the pharmaceutical, biotech, technology, consumer goods, retail, and construction and project development realms.

Maja’s own cultural background and her experience working across the globe have allowed her to apply unique and practical solutions to her work at RHR. For Maja, strength in executive coaching and talent management lies not only within a deep understanding of a person but also of the culture that shapes them. Maja finds that digging deep and asking the right questions to create maximum impact for her clients is extremely rewarding.

Maja prides herself on her ability to accelerate the development of women in the workplace. Professional achievements include founding a women’s networking group while at Skanska, a Fortune 500 construction and project development company, which continues today and has placed a number of women in top leadership positions at the firm. She also coaches women to become thriving organizational leaders as part of her role at RHR.

Maja finds her willingness to take risks, her unwavering authenticity, and her commitment to equity are the backbone of her work. Helping her clients reach their goals is equally important to her; simply put, she says, “If it matters for them, it matters for me.”

Maja’s talent-management career began at Skanska, where she headed the firm’s leadership-succession and diversity-and-inclusion efforts. Prior to Skanska, she worked as a business psychologist at the consultancy firm PAT Management in Lund, Sweden.

Maja graduated from Umeå University in 2001 with a master’s degree in clinical psychology. She is a psychologist licensed by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and a member of the Swedish Psychological Association. Additionally, Maja is certified in organizational development with the NTL Institute (National Training Laboratories Institute). When she’s not working, she enjoys listening to podcasts, mountain biking, camping, cooking, hiking, traveling, and spending time with her two children.
