post_content = "2020 was a landmark year. “Unprecedented” became the word most commonly used to refer to the unbelievable, challenging, and life-changing events that affected each and every one of us.

Now, looking back, we asked our own in-house experts and community members to reflect on the question, <b><i>“what was your most important leadership lesson learned this year?” </i></b>

Their thoughts and messages represent a powerful summary of key lessons learned. From leading with empathy to realizing the importance of a cohesive company purpose over profit, these messages are a great starting point for enhancing your own leadership style during times of crisis

We hope you will be inspired to take these ideas forward and <a href=\"https://rhrdev.kingscrestglobal.com/solutions-development/\">lead with resilience</a>, innovative thinking, and bravery, now and in the future."
