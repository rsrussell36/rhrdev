A former athlete and business executive, Kelsey displays an intrinsic capacity for teamwork and strategic thinking. Throughout his work at RHR, he leverages his psychology background to identify the underlying factors driving and inhibiting performance and applies the principles of performance psychology to drive impactful and sustainable change. He prides himself in being a thought partner to clients and utilizes his business experience to ensure his work with clients is anchored in and aligned with their business objectives.

Kelsey lives the values he instils in the work with his clients: showing up consistently, upholding honesty and candor, and being responsive to the needs of others. He is motivated by the understanding that well-run organizations lead to more opportunity for impact across both business and society. He finds true satisfaction in helping his clients create healthy and impactful organizations where employees and stakeholders at all levels are able to thrive.

Prior to joining RHR, Kelsey worked for a global executive search firm where he was a core member of the assessment and development practice. In addition to working with clients on a variety of talent management projects, he also held both regional and national leadership roles. In his last role with that firm, he was responsible for leading all aspects of U.S. research as a member of the global research leadership team — an experience that helps Kelsey relate to his clients’ leadership challenges in a unique way.

Kelsey received a psychology Bachelor’s degree from Marquette University. He then obtained a master’s degree in industrial and organizational psychology and a PsyD in business psychology from The Chicago School of Professional Psychology.

Outside of work, Kelsey can be found enjoying time with his family. Originally from Wisconsin, he also enjoys activities that bring him outdoors and spending time in nature. Although his days of athletic competition are behind him, he enjoys staying active and experimenting with many aspects of the tools that he brings to client engagements centered around performance psychology and energy management."
