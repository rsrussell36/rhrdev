post_content = "Most discussions about executive team effectiveness typically focus on the ideal mix of personal characteristics or “stages” of team development that need to be accomplished before the team can be <span>classified</span> as high performing.

RHR took a different approach. We compared and contrasted high-performing and low-performing executive teams and then looked at what they did, how often they did it, and which indicators of organizational performance were impacted as a result.

Using RHR's STE Survey<sup>SM</sup> (Senior Team Effectiveness Survey), data was collected from 200 senior team members predominately from companies with annual revenues of $2 billion and six success factors were isolated."
