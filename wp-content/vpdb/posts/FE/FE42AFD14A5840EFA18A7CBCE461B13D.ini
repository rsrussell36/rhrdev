post_content = "Once the excitement of the promotion fades, every high-potential executive faces a harsh realityâ€”the need to deliver. For a lucky few, the transition is seamless, almost effortless.

Even those with seemingly limitless upward potential eventually find themselves at a pivotal point: the place where fundamental shifts in approach and style are required."
