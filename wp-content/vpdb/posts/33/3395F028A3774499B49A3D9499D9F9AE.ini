post_content = "Traci Berliner is a partner at RHR International. With more than 20 years of experience as a business psychologist, she delivers unparalleled expertise and a consistent approach to leadership development. Primarily, she helps companies create long-lasting systemic change, working with CEOs and senior management on succession-planning efforts and accelerating the growth of executive talent through innovative development experiences.

As companies mature and grow, so do their needs. Upon reaching maturity, the transactional is swapped out for the strategic, and this is when Traci is usually brought in to deliver her signature expertise. She helps companies find their strategic-leadership goals and implement clear plans around succession and development. In addition, she helps architect the change agenda and steward the evolution of key senior executives. Within transformation, there are many different levers to pull to effect change, and Traci’s work ensures that the right levers are pulled at the right times. Traci is also well-known for her work in assessing the executive-succession bench, ensuring that the most critical roles are filled in a considered and strategic way.

Motivated by impact, Traci is passionate about the fact that the leaders she develops will go on to influence thousands of other people. Above all, she is committed to operating with honesty and integrity. Traci is drawn to RHR’s commitment to rigor and is a contributor to the many processes in place to ensure that data is at the heart of all RHR advisory and development work. Deeply curious, she brings an open-minded, probing approach to her work and aims to help leaders feel whole. Her approach is also centered around the concept of choice and her staunch belief that leaders have agency and choice in the process of changing and developing themselves.

Prior to joining RHR, Traci led her own consulting company, designing and executing programs for clients in the areas of individual assessment and coaching, senior leadership team development, and performance management. Previously, she served a Fortune 100 consumer product company, most recently as global head and vice president of executive and organizational development and diversity. When she is not attending high-energy workout classes, Traci can be found spending time with her large family."
