Scheduling and organizing many of the Toronto office’s assessment and coaching engagements, Lisa has a broad range of project-management experience that enables her to empower the teams she works with. Lisa is known for her ability to look at a project’s long-term roadmap and notice roadblocks or risks, enabling her to mitigate these problems before they arise. Flexible and nimble, Lisa works with clients and colleagues across industries and business sizes. She enjoys managing large and complicated projects and is never one to back down from a challenge. Dedicated to every part of her work, Lisa is honest, reflective, and reliable and always finds time to help her colleagues.

Prior to joining RHR, Lisa worked with Coca-Cola and SAP Canada and also owned her own event-management company. Her event-management experience contributed significantly to her skill as a project coordinator, as both roles are highly detail-oriented while also requiring a broad and clear end-to-end vision.

Lisa graduated from St. Bonaventure University with a master’s degree in professional leadership and earned a bachelor’s degree in applied behavioral science from National Louis University. She is an active member of her community and dedicates her time to community-service programs in underserved areas of her city. Lisa is also an officer in the Canadian chapter of her sorority, which is focused on assisting underserved women and children."
