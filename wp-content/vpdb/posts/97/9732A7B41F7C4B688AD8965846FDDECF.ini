post_content = "Andrea Burleson is a partner at RHR International, specializing in assessment and coaching for clients in the energy, consumer packaged products, retail, professional services, and biotechnology industries. Leveraging her 30-plus years of talent assessment, succession planning, and coaching experience, Andrea connects the dots to paint a cohesive picture of a leader’s strengths and opportunities for growth.

Andrea provides leaders with insights that can amplify their leadership capabilities and navigate pivotal shifts in their work and careers. She uses multiple tools to understand how leaders’ personalities and behaviors are working for or against them in their pursuit of goals. She then offers guidance on leveraging strengths and strengthening capabilities in underdeveloped competencies. In her role as advisor and coach, Andrea offers candid and direct feedback in a developmentally focused, actionable way. She recognizes that assessment is a tool for generating insight but is only one step in driving improvement. The goal of assessment (or any talent-development process) is to help leaders pinpoint what to work on and how, which should then increase their impact and effectiveness and ultimately, drive business growth and success.

Andrea brings a depth of talent-management experience to RHR. She previously served as a senior consultant at United Airlines, where she managed the corporation’s talent-management system redesign and implementation among other selection and survey projects. She then moved into a talent-management role with Exelon Corporation, where she led succession planning and senior team effectiveness initiatives for a subset of the fleet’s plants. After leaving her talent-management role at Exelon, she went into consulting, where she continued working with nuclear power fleets and plants (including Entergy, TVA, and Fermi) along with clients in a range of industries including quick-service restaurants, professional services, and insurance.

Andrea received a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas. She earned a master’s degree and a PhD in industrial and organizational psychology from DePaul University, where she later held adjunct teaching roles. She is a member of the American Psychological Association, the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology, and the International Coaching Federation. She is also a certified professional coach through the American College of Executive Coaching and certified in Hogan assessment. Outside of work, Andrea can typically be found outdoors with her daughter building their knowledge of child-friendly venues in the Austin area. They enjoy playing in parks, biking, hiking through the woods, and establishing a deep and lifelong relationship with nature."
