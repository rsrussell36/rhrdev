<span>Lysa joined RHR in 2007, bringing with her more than 25 years of in-depth executive assessment and objective testing expertise. Under her leadership and guidance, RHR implemented the Hogan Assessment as part of its testing practice, providing senior executives and teams with insights into patterns and behaviors that shape the way they work. Lysa not only oversees and facilitates those tests but also acts as a mentor to her colleagues, providing expert interpretation to heighten their knowledge and deliver the highest possible impact to their clients.</span>

<span>Respect and understanding are two values central to Lysa’s work. She is known for her expert ability to be honest with people in an empathetic manner; being committed to their success includes being direct about their strengths and opportunities for growth, and she conducts those conversations with warmth and candor. Ultimately, Lysa is driven by her desire to make a difference and add value to people’ lives by helping them unearth the insights that lead them to positive, trajectory-altering changes.</span>

<span>Prior to joining RHR, Lysa worked in the medical field in Kaiser’s organizational-development department, helping physicians to become more resilient and effective leaders.

Lysa earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Texas and a PhD in counseling psychology with a specialization in industrial and organizational psychology from the University of North Texas. She is a member of the American Psychological Association and the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology. She has also previously served as the president of the Laguna Beach Community Clinic board of directors.</span>

<span>Outside of work, Lysa can usually be found enjoying the Southern California sunshine, either at the beach or in the mountains. She also enjoys exercising, taking walks along Dana Point Harbor, reading, cooking, and bringing her competitive spirit to a good game of blackjack.</span>"
