post_content = "Aurelie is a Project Coordinator at RHR International in the UK. Her work adds structure and discipline to many engagements; she anticipates clients' needs and mobilises accordingly to deliver results that drive long-term client satisfaction.

Aurelie contributes to managing the logistics and execution of large-scale, global leadership programmes throughout each project's lifecycle. She works with her RHR colleagues and also with clients’ key stakeholders to create tracked and sustained project momentum and key documentation to ensure that timelines are met and results are achieved. Quick decision-making, risk minimisation, and problem-solving are essential skills she has attained through the years.
Aurelie’s greatest motivator is to be challenged. She enjoys working on complicated projects and making a real, tangible impact. In addition to her primary responsibilities at RHR, Aurelie is constantly learning and looking for new ways to develop her own skills. She is a member of the Alumni Mentor Programme in collaboration with Upwardly Global and takes pride in mentoring her peers, enabling them to reach higher levels of performance.

Her expertise has evolved through partnerships with both international market leaders and grassroots companies, and she brings nearly two decades of business management experience to her current role. Before joining RHR, Aurelie developed an in-depth knowledge of cross-cultural issues in business. In her previous role, she travelled extensively, managing and administering assessment centres in all regions of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

Aurelie has become an expert in nutrition since her son’s first anaphylactic episode. She aims to raise awareness through the Anaphylaxis Campaign and the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation, organisations that support people at risk of severe allergic reactions. Additionally, her criminology dissertation was published in a book focusing on green criminology. This passion for the environment also inspires Aurelie at work, where she is a part of RHR’s Forces of Nature initiative, which helps raise awareness and change around the climate crisis."
