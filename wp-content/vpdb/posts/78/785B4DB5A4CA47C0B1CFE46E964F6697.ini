post_content = "Sarah Gilbert serves as RHR’s Director of Operations and IT. Armed with an extensive background in journalism, strategic planning, IT, and change management, she employs her deep-rooted technical and analytical skills to keep RHR running like a well-oiled machine. Her work is not only instrumental in reshaping RHR’s operations, but also in bolstering the firm’s employee engagement and diversity and inclusion initiatives.

Though she’s spent the bulk of her career in the technology sphere, Sarah’s professional life began in the newsroom. After graduating with a Master’s degree in journalism and mass communications from the University of Colorado at Boulder, she developed an insatiable curiosity for the way the world works. To this day, that curiosity is the driving force behind her work, enabling her to critically examine every aspect of RHR’s operations and opportunities for growth. Given that she directly oversees 35 employees and three managers, it also enables her to assess how to continuously improve the way her own teams function.

Sarah’s ability to restructure operations has also become vital to RHR’s impressive employee engagement and retention rate, a professional achievement that she takes pride in. Upon her arrival to RHR, she was instrumental in the redesigning and rebuilding of the operations team, reducing turnover and doubling its size. By leading with authenticity and fervor, she is able to build top-performing teams that ultimately yield profound business results.

Curiosity isn’t the only thing that makes Sarah tick. Her values of fearlessness and quality, paired with strategic problem-solving skills and a genuine care for her colleagues also act as cornerstones to her role. She is a staunch advocate for underrepresented groups in both life and work and plays an active role in furthering RHR’s diversity and inclusion initiatives.

Prior to joining RHR, Sarah worked in account management and change management roles for numerous technology companies, delivering sophisticated financial research and planning tools to companies like Schwab, Fidelity, and Goldman-Sachs. She served as a strategist and change manager for Oppenheimerfunds, Inc, spearheading an overhaul of the company’s IT business strategy. She also oversaw a team of 40 developers at Travelport, Inc. to deliver custom travel software to multinational companies, including IBM and Nike, to manage travel and expenses.

Sarah lives in the pristine Colorado mountains with her wife, two daughters, and two dogs. In her free time, she can typically be found outdoors, whether skiing, hiking, or playing tennis. She also enjoys embarking on creative projects, like writing, sewing, and crafting (it’s nearly impossible for her to walk by a Michael’s without at least peeking inside). In addition to her Master’s in journalism, she holds a Bachelor’s degree in neuroscience and cognitive psychology from Queen’s University in Ontario, Canada, and an MBA from the University of Colorado at Denver."
