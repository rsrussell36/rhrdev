post_content = "Rebecca Helle is a project coordinator at RHR International. She leverages her diverse, entrepreneurial background and logistical skillset to drive vital project outcomes across a broad range of RHR’s global projects.

Rebecca supports RHR’s senior partners and ensures that the project-management elements of the company’s leadership-consulting work are completed to the highest standard. From timeline management to scheduling and statements of work, Rebecca is relied upon to create consistent process and order. She works with both her RHR colleagues and directly with clients in order to connect and support.

A constant learner, Rebecca places great emphasis on pushing herself out of her comfort zone to reach higher levels of growth and achievement. She has worked as part of the Senior Team Effectiveness team for the last several years and has helped with the development of the achievements they’ve made and the offerings RHR delivers in this specialized field. She has a keen sense of responsibility and is known for always going above and beyond to deliver. Additionally, Rebecca enjoys building meaningful relationships with her colleagues and clients.

Prior to joining RHR, Rebecca studied and worked in hospitality management. She then moved to Italy, where she owned and ran a restaurant and a couple of wine shops for several years before shifting to executive assistant work. The coordination and high-level decision making she developed during these experiences now enables her to excel in her role as a project coordinator at RHR.

Outside of work, Rebecca enjoys cooking, gardening, and spending time with her family. She also has a focus on charitable work and makes time to volunteer whenever she can."
